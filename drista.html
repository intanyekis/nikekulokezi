Likewise, She has not revealed her face, due to which much information about her is not found. Therefore, She uses Twitter which has few followers and has not posted any information about her life and what she is doing currently.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.webofbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Drista-Age.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Drista_Real_Name><strong>Drista Real Name</strong></span></h3><p>Drista is a nickname given by his brother Dream to his 15 years old sister. He gave this name Drista, which means Dream brother. Likewise, Drista’s real name is revealed and is Bella, but her last name is still unclear as his brother Dream has Gonzalez as his last name, so from there, we can identify that Drista also has the same last name her real name is Bella Gonzalez. Her brother gave her a beautiful and thoughtful name, who always wanted a sister, and his dream came true, so he used his name for her sister’s name.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Drista_And_Dream><strong>Drista And Dream</strong></span></h3><p>Drista is a sister of his brother Dream, an American Youtuber and a twitch streamer who is doing good on Youtube and probably has earned a lot of name and fame. He was born on August 12, 1999, and runs a gaming channel through his and his sister’s names. Therefore, He gained the most popularity among his fans and followers in 2019 and now is a well-known gamer YouTuber.</p><p>Drista and Dream share a great bond, and Dream kept his sister’s name by sharing his ideas and creativity on his own. The Dream also has his youtube channel, where he posts all his gaming videos and earns a good amount of money from Youtube. Likewise, his net worth is estimated at $5 million, which is a considerable amount he is making at 23 years old. The money that he earns is sufficient to fulfil the needs and demands of him and his family.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Drista_SMP><strong>Drista SMP</strong></span></h3><p>SMP stands for survival multiplayer, and these games became more popular over the last few years because of the Dream, which turned out to be a hit. Likewise, Drista has played on her brother’s name, Dream SMP, and turns out to be the ‘Goddess of the chaos’ in her brother’s Smp. In this game, we can see that Drista attacks Dream with a fork, which seems interesting.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Drista_Face_Reveal><strong>Drista Face Reveal</strong></span></h3><p>Drista has not revealed her face till now, and because of that, we cannot identify what she looks like. Likewise, She doesn’t seem to be much active on social media. She hardly can be recognized, but because of her famous YouTuber brother, she has also gained popularity as her identity is private.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Trivia><strong>Trivia</strong></span></h3><ul><li>Drista is a 15 years old sister of the famous brother Dream.</li><li>Drista has also been the subject of some of her brother’s tweets.</li><li>She has the nickname given by her brother Dream.</li><li>Drista’s real name is Bella Gonzalez, revealed after many years.</li><li>She claims to be a fan of Harry Styles from One Direction.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLHBqJ2boZ9jsLC5jp2poquklnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1166903-bray-wyatt-daniel-bryan-strap-match.html><span>←</span><span>The Fiend Defeats Daniel Bryan In Brutal Strap Match, Retains Universal Championship</span></a>
