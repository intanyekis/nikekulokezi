The then-23-year-old was shot in the arm and robbed while at the car wash.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I still go to the car wash. Yeah, I know what happened, definitely, 100 percent,” Flocka said. “I thank God for that, too. That was a blessing, because that weekend, I was making like a quarter million [dollars].” He goes on to reveal he was participating in illicit drug transactions before a divine presence stepped in.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I was going to buy some bricks and some pounds. And that’s God that stopped me. I thank God because I was arrogant as f**k. It turned me dark all the way… That Waka died that day, too.” The revelations he gained from this situation jumpstarted a hot streak in his music career.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The “O Let’s Do It” artist went on to release <a href=# rel=nofollow>Flockaveli</a> in 2010, which included classic records such as “No Hands” featuring Roscoe Dash and <a href=#>Wale</a> and “Hard In Da Paint.” The following year, he partnered with his 1017 Brick Squad comrade <a href=# rel=nofollow>Gucci Mane</a> for the collaborative project <a href=# rel=nofollow>Ferrari Boyz</a>, only to come back again the next year with Triple F Life: Fans, Friends & Family.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Both Flockaveli and Triple F Life reached the top 10 of the Billboard 200 albums chart, while “No Hands” and “O Let’s Do It” charted on the Billboard Hot 100. Waka also stepped into the <a href=# rel=nofollow>wider entertainment realm</a>, appearing on VH1’s Love & Hip-Hop: Atlanta, Marriage Boot Camp: Hip Hop Edition, and his own show Waka & Tammy alongside his now-ex, <a href=#>Tammy Rivera</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Waka Flocka Flame hasn’t been too active musically as of late, though he did appear on “Sick Of Ballin 2.0” with Yung Nation and Dorrough Music. Needless to say, his unfortunate 2010 incident was a blessing in disguise that set him on the right path.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6yurK2Mn6Oom5uWeqe4wKacZqyYlrusstSlZKCdpKm2r7OMrJ%2BorF1mf3SAlmtrbWhnZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./homeless-arrested-i85-atlanta-bridge-fire-500963.html><span>←</span><span>Three Arrested In Connection To Atlanta I-85 Bridge Fire</span></a>
