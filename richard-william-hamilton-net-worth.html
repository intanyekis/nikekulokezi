While working there, he discovered his ability to draw, and soon enough enrolled at Saint Martin’s School of Art. After a short time he enrolled at the Royal Academy Schools, but when the war broke out, he was forced to work as a technical draftsman, and so quit his education. After the War, he returned to the Royal Academy, but was expelled, due to “not profiting from the instruction”, stated by the school`s officials. Nevertheless, he then entered the Slade School of Art, University College, London.</p><p>His professional career really began two years later, when his first exhibition saw the light of the day, held at the Institute of Contemporary Arts. At the same time he worked as a teacher at the Central School of Art and Design, so his net worth was established.<br>Since then his career went only upwards; his early works became extremely popular, including “Growth and Form”, and “Man, Machine and Motion”. In 1956 he was a part of the art exhibition “This Is Tomorrow”, exhibiting his own work, “Just what is it that makes today’s homes so different, so appealing?”.</p><p>Little by little his name became more known in the London art scene, and he used the first chance to expand abroad. Throughout his career, Richard held exhibitions across Europe, in cities such as Berlin in 1974, Amsterdam in 1976, Bielefeld 1978, Edinburgh, 1988 and a year later in Stockholm, Winterthur 1990 and also in the 1990s he held his first exhibition in San Francisco, at the Museum of Modern Art. In the 2000s, he held several further successful exhibitions, including the ‘A Host of Angels’ in 2007 in Venice, ‘Pixelated Angels in Virtual Spaces’ in 2008 in Bielefeld, and ‘Modern Moral Matters’ in 2010 in London, which was his last exhibition before his death.</p><p>During his career, Richard received numerous prestigious awards, including the William and Noma Copley Foundation Award, 1960, and the same year he received the John Moores Contemporary Painting Prize. He was also the recipient of Talens Prize International award in 1970, and of the Arnold Bode Prize in 1996. In 1999 he was made a Companion of Honour, and as laye in his life as 2006, he won the Max Beckmann Prize for painting.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Richard was married to Rita Donagh from 1991 until his death in 1991.
