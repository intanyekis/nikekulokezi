However, Myna Snacks' Midnight Mini Cookies distinguished themselves by including extra vitamins and nutrients.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Kai Cenat thrilled as his viral backflip video with Duke Dennis garners Chris Brown's attention</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/e8354102-d7d6-4b90-92f1-581ca1c940f9.1472428551><p>One X (formerly Twitter) user accused Pokimane of merely branding an existing product under her name and selling it at a higher price, fueling skepticism among those who began to view the streamer as deceitful.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>LowTierGod becomes next streamer to review Pokimane’s Midnight Cookies, calls them ‘edible dirt’</a></p><p>Conversely, numerous individuals, including fellow Twitch streamers, defended the pricing of Myna Snacks. They highlighted that the Mini Midnight Cookie packages contain four 400g packs, justifying the cost.</p><h2 class=split>Pokimane addressed the accusation</h2><p>Myna Snacks and Pokimane both issued statements in response to the accusations. They underlined that the recipe for Myna Snacks Midnight Mini Cookies is special and exclusive to the brand.</p><p>Pokimane took it to platform X and wrote, "There's been some confusion about the product I launched, and I'm here to set the record straight."</p><p>The streamer also addressed accusations that Myna Snacks is a white-labeled Toatzy. She claimed that most food products sold in stores have white labels and that ingredient refining is a common procedure in the food sector.</p><p>The main reason for the pricing difference was not because Pokimane owned the company, but rather the quality of ingredients utilized in Myna Snacks' cookies.</p><p>At the end of her speech, Pokimane reaffirmed that Myna Snacks is not a money grab. She went on to say that if she were doing it for the money, she wouldn't worry about sponsorships or place a cap on her Twitch donations.&nbsp;</p><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>Kai Cenat gives a review of Pokimane's controversial Midnight cookies: 'S**t's dry'</a></p><p><a href=#>Pokimane pledges to do 'better' as she acknowledges controversy amid snack company backlash: 'S**t happens'</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRonailubC%2ByKeeZqynnsGktIyqrJ6dnmK9sLfIppinnaNiu6bDjK%2Bcp6ylp7JuudinmGarnpawrL%2BMnKanrKKkw6a%2B0rI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./china-anne-mcclain-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>China Anne McClain Net Worth How Much Is China Anne McClain Worth?</span></a>
