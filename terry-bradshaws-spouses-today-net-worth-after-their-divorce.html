The man secured four Superbowl wins during his NFL career and transitioned seamlessly into sportscasting once his esteemed football career was behind him. His contagious smile, charming personality, and all-around good guy attitude make him an easy guy to root for. Television & movie executives were smart enough to see these qualities in Terry, too.Soon enough <a href=#>he became a featured actor</a> and <a href=#>a reality tv star</a>. His family’s reality show on E!, The Bradshaw Bunch, documents his illustrious life with his wife Tammy and their three daughters.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is What Fans Really Think About The Bradshaw Bunch</a></span>What some viewers might not have known before the show, however, is just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how many wives Terry has had</a>. While Terry doesn’t often speak about his ex-wives, he was previously married to three incredibly smart and successful women. They’ve gone on to lead lives full of fortune, as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=terry-bradshaw-rsquo-s-first-wife-melissa-babish-has-a-net-worth-of-1-million>Terry Bradshaw’s First Wife Melissa Babish Has A Net Worth Of $1 Million</h2><p>Terry married his first wife, Melissa Babish, in 1972. He was early into his NFL career, and she had just come off the heels of winning Miss Teenage America in 1970. The marriage only lasted a year.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">There’s really not much known about Melissa Babish</a>. After their divorce, she went dark. According to online sources, she has an estimated net worth of $1 million.</p><p>When asked about his first marriage, Terry doesn’t speak in detail about his relationship with Melissa or what life was like behind closed doors. But he has been candid about his own wrongdoings in the relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with Sports Illustrated, Terry admitted to feeling guilty about the divorce and being moody during the relationship. A devout Christian, Terry admitted he had strayed from his values during that time, drinking heavily and flirting with women. He found footing in his faith again in the aftermath of the relationship.</p><h2 id=what-s-terry-bradshaw-rsquo-s-second-wife-angelica-jojo-starbuck-s-net-worth>What's Terry Bradshaw’s Second Wife, Angelica "Jojo" Starbuck's Net Worth?</h2><p>Despite his first marriage’s quick demise, Terry wasn’t turned off by love.

Sources told the Washington Post that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jojo said their relationship was floundering</a>, with Terry agreeing with her and encouraging her to come home and be with him in order to make it work. But that was just the thing, Jojo wasn’t the stay-at-home type. She loved to skate, and she needed to do it, for it to be a part of her life. To this day, at 70 years old she still laces up and gets out on the ice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jojo made a beautiful life for herself after her divorce from Terry.

The pair had actually met back when Charlotte was 17 and Terry 22. They dated for four years, but their relationship fizzled out, with Terry going to pursue his football career and Charlotte pursuing a career in family law. Fate had other plans, and the two reconnected during his divorce from Jojo.

As hard as they tried, after 16 years of marriage, the couple decided to call it quits. They’ve never opened up about the reasons behind the divorce, with the filing citing irreconcilable differences.</p><p>The two are amicable, with Charlotte even keeping Bradshaw as her last name. Fans may even be able to get a glimpse of Charlotte <a href=#>if season 3 of The Bradshaw Bunch gets the green light</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Much Terry Bradshaw's Daughters Are Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Charlotte continued her law career after her divorce, becoming a force of nature within the Texas law world.
