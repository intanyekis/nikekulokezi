The shows pay a premium, but these investments can be worth it. Just look at The Morning Show, which is paying <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a> a whole lot <a href=#>more than she made on Friends</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gaslit is taking a similar approach by using Julia Robert and Sean Penn to entice audiences. The show has been <a href=#>deemed worth the watch</a>, and now that more details are emerging about the show, fans want to know which star has the highest net worth.</p><p>Let's take a look and see which Gaslit star's net worth stands above the rest.</p><h2 id=39-gaslit-39-is-a-brand-new-project>'Gaslit' Is A Brand New Project</h2><p>Just last month, political thriller Gaslit made it to debut on Starz. Based on the first season of the Slow Burn podcast, the show was able to rope in some of the most impressive names in the entertainment industry to bring its story to life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Starring Julia Roberts and Sean Penn, the series focuses on the Watergate scandal and on a number of untold stories surrounding it. This type of content is always able to drum up interest, and Starz clearly thinks it was worth the investment.</p><p>Interestingly, Robert would not agree to do the project with Penn, something that creator Robbie Pickering was unsure about.</p><p>"I didn’t ever think we’d get her but her one requirement was that she act with Sean Penn. You didn’t have to twist my arm, but I didn’t say yes right away — I had to eat dinner with him. I was so nervous I showed up in this leather jacket that I shouldn’t have been wearing. But I was like, ‘Sean Penn is a tough guy! I have to look cool,'" Pickering said.</p><p>The names involved with the project are impressive, as are their respective net worths. When looking at the numbers, however, there are clear-cut top names.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Which 'Walking Dead' Actor Has The Highest Net Worth?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sean-penn-is-worth-70-million>Sean Penn Is Worth $70 Million</h2><p>Coming in at the number two spot is Sean Penn, a man who has been turning in fantastic work since the 1980s. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Penn is sitting on a cool $70 million, which largely stems from his acting work.</p><p>Some of Penn's biggest movies include Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Carlito's Way, Dead Man Walking, 21 Grams, Mystic River, and Milk.</p><p>Penn's net worth has had a dramatic shift over time, as Celebrity Net Worth notes, "His net worth was previously much higher when combined with ex-wife Robin Wright. They were married from 1996 to 2010 and had two children together. Sean reportedly paid Robin a very large portion of his net worth as a divorce settlement. Reportedly as much as $50 million."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite losing a major chunk of his net worth following his divorce, Penn is still worth tens of millions of dollars. Not only that, but he is still regarded as one of the most talented performers working in the industry today.</p><p>It's amazing to see what Sean Penn has been able to accomplish financially, but he still falls well short of the performer with the highest net worth from the cast of Gaslit.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Which 'Love Is Blind' Cast Member Has The Highest Net Worth?</a></span></p><h2 id=julia-roberts-is-worth-250-million>Julia Roberts Is Worth $250 Million</h2><p>Sitting comfortably at number one is none other than the legendary Julia Roberts who is currently sporting a net worth of $250 million, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the biggest years of her career, Julia Roberts was a powerhouse in Hollywood, and she was collecting unprecedented paychecks for her work on the big screen.</p><p>For example, "For her 2003 film "Mona Lisa Smile," Roberts received a fee of $25 million, which was unheard of at the time," the site notes.</p><p>While Roberts didn't start out making a premium, she was able to cash in on a consistent basis on Pretty Woman, a film for which she only made $300,000 for, became a breakout hit at the box office.</p><p>Over time, her films would go on to gross billions of dollars, and she managed to pull off this feat without relying on major franchise pictures.</p><p>The actress has also managed to make bank from endorsements.</p><p>"Roberts landed an endorsement deal with Gianfranco Ferre in 2006, for which she was paid $6 million. She is also the global brand ambassador of cosmetics brand Lancome Paris since 2009. She made a five-year deal with Lancome in 2010, which she earned $50 million for," Celebrity Net Worth writes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Cast of 'Dawson's Creek': Who Has The Highest Net Worth Today?</a></span></p><p>The cast of Gaslit is impressively successful, but Roberts is still well ahead of the pack.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Does Miley Cyrus Have The Highest Net Worth Of All Disney Channel Stars?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiemqucnsFuvsCnop6cXZfGbrrErWSwp6KptXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vanessa-bryant-reacts-to-taylor-swift-wearing-kobe-quote-necklace.html><span>←</span><span>Vanessa Bryant Reacts to Taylor Swift Wearing Kobe Quote Necklace</span></a>
