The doctors found a gestational sac growing in her uterus. However, it was smaller than they'd expected and did not have anything in it.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>According to Web MD, the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">gestational sac</a> is where the fetus develops after an egg is fertilized in the uterus.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>After her physicians found the empty gestational sac, they assumed that Samantha might have a blighted ovum.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Meaning, despite the fertilized egg being&nbsp;implanted in the uterus,&nbsp;it would not develop into an embryo. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In such a state, Samantha would still show signs of <span>being pregnant</span>&nbsp;like elevated HCG levels, but the empty sac would most likely result in a miscarriage during&nbsp;the first trimester.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Samantha, who shares an infant son, Brexton, with Kyle, admitted in the video that the news was tough to process. Still, her doctors asked her to not lose hope and come back the following&nbsp;week.&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently, her doctors were accommodating the possibility of delayed implantation.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>A Glimmer of Hope</h2><p>Following the disheartening visit to the hospital, the mother of one started bleeding and experiencing severe day-long cramps.&nbsp;Her go-to thought was that she was miscarrying.&nbsp;</p><p>In an attempt to take their mind off of, what appeared to be, a heartbreak waiting to happen, they went out to Richmond.&nbsp;There Samantha couldn't help but lock herself in a bus so she would not have to see anyone.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>As per the doctors' instructions, the couple went for an ultrasound the following week and were surprised by the results. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Samantha <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">explained</a> that her doctors discovered two little sacs, one of which came out of nowhere. Further&nbsp;adding,&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>We saw the ultrasound and both literally like jaws to the floor, couldn't close our mouths, just like unbelievable.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The doctors then&nbsp;explained that they could catch a "flutter" of a heartbeat during the exam. The doctors sent the couple back with expectations of twins and called them in for another exam in a week's time.&nbsp;</p><h2>Falling from Cloud 9</h2><p>Admittedly, the couple had their hopes up, and they spent the next eight days anticipating a positive result.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Samantha recalled that they had&nbsp;been thinking about&nbsp;what a nursery would look like with twins. The two were even thinking about what they would name their kids.&nbsp;</p><p>"It was so positive seeing that&nbsp;snap-second flicker of a sack starting to form," she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> in the video.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Sadly, their eight days of wishful thinking did not find real-world expression because the tests done on that day revealed that there was still nothing there.&nbsp;</p><p>After getting their hopes up for the longest eight days of their lives, the couple was forced to face the grim diagnosis that they were presented in the first place. Samantha <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">concluded</a>,&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>That means I will either naturally miscarry over the next few days or medically.</p><p>Samantha shared that she believed infertility was&nbsp;cruel and unfair before she logged off.&nbsp;</p><p>Samantha and Kyle have been struggling with infertility for over eight years and have gone through everything from a miscarriage to failed IVF attempts.&nbsp;</p><p>Since their wedding was in 2017, it is evident that they were having these problems before they exchanged wedding rings.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Even so, the infertility struggles took a toll on their marriage, and in March 2021, Samantha even <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">admitted</a> to People that the couple even considered getting divorced after her miscarriage.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlno5a6orrToZhmmqWosKl51p6bnaGenHqxvsSgpZqmpGO1tbnL</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./milu-e-horsk.html><span>←</span><span>Milue Horsk</span></a>
