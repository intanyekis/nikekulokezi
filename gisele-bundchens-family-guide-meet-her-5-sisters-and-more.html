Mommy, I cannot imagine all the work and dedication to raising us 6!” she captioned a July 2019 Instagram photo of herself, Vânia and her five sisters — Patricia, Raquel, Graziela, Gabriela and Rafaela. “Eternally grateful for everything you have done and continue to do for us. Thank you for always loving and inspiring us. I love you soooo much!”</p><p>The businesswoman also showed her father some love for his birthday in May 2020.</p><p>“Thank you for being an example of integrity, reliability, love, courage and commitment,” she captioned a throwback photo of her father walking her down the aisle when she married ex-husband<a href=#><strong> Tom Brady</strong> </a>in 2009. “Thank you for being our counselor, for leading the way, for always helping and encouraging all of us to make a difference. Thank you for being the best father in the world!”</p><p>Despite always <a href=#>speaking highly</a> of her family, Gisele previously opened up about an incident where she lost her temper with her twin and said things she later regretted.</p><p>“I kept thinking what an idiot I was. I <a href=#>love all my sisters</a>. Why had I been so mean? My justification — But Pati was mean to me first! She started it! — suddenly seemed lame,” she recalled in her memoir. “There were so many other, better ways I could have dealt with the situation, like saying, ‘I’m sorry you feel that way about me’, or ‘Why don’t we speak again tomorrow?’ I didn’t need to slam my sister, but I had, and I spent the next day or two incredibly upset.”</p><p>The twins made a rare red carpet appearance together in May 2023 at the Luz Alliance Gala in Miami, helping to raise nearly $1 million for the Brazil foundation to benefit restoration efforts in their home country.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Patricia is primarily based in Brazil with her husband and two children, where she works as Gisele’s manager. Us Weekly confirmed in October 2022 that Gisele had begun <a href=#>living in Miami</a> amid <a href=#>her divorce</a> from Brady. The exes — who share <a href=#>son Benjamin</a>, born in 2009, and <a href=#>daughter Vivian</a>, born in 2012 — previously moved from Massachusetts to Tampa, Florida, together in 2020.</p><p>Keep scrolling for a guide to Bündchen’s big family:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNktKq%2FxKWcZpqlo7GktMSnqmaekaK2rcWMoKyinJViuqax02afnqpdanq0tdKtnKurXZa7pXnMqKmeZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christy-brinkley-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Christy Brinkley Net Worth How Much Is Christy Brinkley Worth?</span></a>
