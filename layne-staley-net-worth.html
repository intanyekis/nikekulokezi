Staley died at the age of 34, ironically on the same day as fellow musician Kurt Cobain, in Seattle. Both musicians struggled with drug addiction.</p><p>In a previously unreleased MTV interview, Staley revealed that he knew he was “near death” less than three months before his overdose. Staley’s father had left the family when he was eight years old, and Staley believed that becoming a famous rock star would bring his father back into his life. His father did reappear after seeing a picture of Staley in a magazine, and they began to rebuild their relationship. However, his father’s drug addiction resurfaced, and the two began to use drugs together. Eventually, Staley’s father became dependent on him for drug money, which contributed to Staley’s own addiction.</p><p>Despite his struggles, Staley continued to fight his addiction until his untimely death. He left behind a musical legacy and a net worth of $5 million.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Music_Interest>Early Life and Music Interest</span></h2><p>Layne Staley was born on August 22, 1967, in Bellevue, Washington, to parents Phillip and Nancy Staley. His parents divorced when he was seven years old, and he was mostly raised by his mother and stepfather, Jim Elmer. Staley attended Meadowdale High School in Lynnwood, where he developed a love for music. He was a fan of several rock bands, including Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, The Stooges, Judas Priest, Twisted Sister, Van Halen, and David Bowie.</p><p>Staley’s interest in music started when he was young, listening to his parents’ music collection. At the age of 12, he started playing drums and became a member of several glam bands in his early teens. By 1984, he had joined a band called Sleze with some of his classmates, which later became Alice N’ Chains in 1986.</p><h2><span id=Alice_in_Chains_and_Staleys_Career>Alice in Chains and Staley’s Career</span></h2><p>Layne Staley began performing in Seattle with Alice in Chains, a group that eventually consisted of Jerry Cantrell, Sean Kinney, and Mike Starr. The group released their debut album “Facelift” in 1990, which went on to become certified double platinum. Staley’s vocals on the hit single “Man in the Box” were particularly noteworthy. They released the EP “Sap” in 1992 and the highly successful album “Dirt” later that year, which debuted at number six on the Billboard 200 chart. The band did not tour extensively due to various members’ struggles with drug addiction, including Staley. In 1994, the band released the EP “Jar of Flies,” which debuted at number one. Staley entered rehab and started working on side projects with other Seattle musicians. The band released their self-titled album in 1995, which was also certified double platinum. The band did not tour much due to Staley’s addictions. They recorded an “MTV Unplugged” episode in 1996, which was one of Staley’s last shows with the band. Staley’s last performance was in July 1996 while Alice in Chains was touring with Kiss. Despite not performing, Staley continued to make music with Alice in Chains.</p><h2><span id=Layne_Staleys_Struggles_with_Addiction_and_Tragic_Death>Layne Staley’s Struggles with Addiction and Tragic Death</span></h2><p>Layne Staley, the lead singer of Alice In Chains, struggled with drug and alcohol abuse throughout much of the 1990s despite several attempts at rehab. Kurt Cobain’s death in 1994 scared Staley into sobriety for a while, but he ultimately relapsed. Friends, including Mike McCready, tried to help him by inviting him to join the sober band Mad Season, but he still had access to drugs.</p><p>In 1996, Staley’s former fiancé died of a drug overdose, which sent him spiraling. He became reclusive and struggled with addiction, losing an extreme amount of weight. On April 19, 2002, Staley was found dead in his Seattle condo, likely having died weeks earlier from a mixture of heroin and cocaine. His death occurred on the same day that Kurt Cobain died eight years prior.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunC4wLKlnmWjqa6tsdhmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katy-blakey.html><span>←</span><span>Katy Blakey Bio, Career, NBC news, Marriage, Husband, Children, Salary, Net worth, Social Media,</span></a>
