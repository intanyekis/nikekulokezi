It seemed no one anticipated the film would ultimately gross more than $300 million. Love, who portrayed Big Worm, revealed in a recent interview that he was only paid $2,500.</p><p>“See, it wasn’t really about the money then,” Love <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> Comedy Hype.&nbsp;“I got to say I’m working, pay my rent, I ain’t out in the street doing no bulls**t. It wasn’t iconic when we did it.”</p><p>One fan took to Twitter accusing <a href=# id=auto-tag_ice-cube data-tag=ice-cube>Ice Cube</a> of “robbing his own people.” Swiftly refuting the allegations, the Compton rapper replied, “<span>I didn’t rob no f**kin body. The 1995 Friday movie cost $2.3m to make. Shot it in 20 days. Fazion worked 1 day, maybe 2. All the actors got paid scale to do the movie. They could’ve simple said ‘No’ but they didn’t.

I guess it’s a slow news week so let me say what I got paid is a moot point, it was the price of admission to a game,” he explained.</p><p>“I have zero regrets. Actually , I want to take this time to thank Cube Dj Pooh and Felix Gary Grey for letting me be apart of such an iconic picture. I truly have nothing but love For these brothers. WestSide N****s!!!!!!!!”</p><p>Schooling the class and also backing up Cube was Next Friday&nbsp;actor and comedian, <a href=# id=auto-tag_michael-blackson data-tag=michael-blackson>Michael Blackson</a>. He revealed that thanks to his appearance in the&nbsp;Friday sequel, he became Africa’s biggest comic, despite only being paid $1,200 for one day’s work.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=# rel=nofollow>@icecube</a> is not to blamed for us getting paid so little it’s the film industry’s pay scale. I got paid $800 a day when I did Next Friday plus overtime I made $1200 for my one day’s work of “I can’t get giggy with this shit”Thanks to next Friday I became the biggest African comic</p><p>— Michael Blackson (@MichaelBlackson) <a href=# rel=nofollow>December 29, 2021</a></p><p>Later, when it was insinuated that <a href=# id=auto-tag_chris-tucker data-tag=chris-tucker>Chris Tucker</a> also turned down his role in Next Friday&nbsp;because of money, the&nbsp;Ride Along&nbsp;star clarified that he declined the role because of religious reasons. Shadily, one fan <a href=# rel=nofollow>mentioned</a> that Tucker tackled a very prominent cussing role in&nbsp;Rush Hour 2&nbsp;for a rumored $20 million, and while that has not been <a href=# rel=nofollow>confirmed or denied</a>, the comedian did mention that he never saw himself reprising his role as Smokey. However, he would at least consider it.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>We were ready to pay Chris Tucker $10-12m to do Next Friday but he turned us down for religious reasons. He didn’t want to cuss or smoke weed on camera anymore. <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/1pfo1FHWzp</a></p><p>— Ice Cube (@icecube) <a href=# rel=nofollow>December 29, 2021</a></p><p>There’s currently no definitive update on the rumored fourth and final film of the franchise, Last Friday.
