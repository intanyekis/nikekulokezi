The bracelets she wore appeared to be the ones she was gifted by <a href=#><strong>Savannah Guthrie</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Hoda Kotb</strong></a> on the October 6 episode of <a href=#>Today</a>.</p><p>During her appearance on the NBC morning show, Donna <a href=#>remained tight-lipped</a> about Travis and Swift’s romance. “I honestly can’t tell you [much],” she stated. “It’s just too new.”</p><p>Thursday marked Swift’s third appearance at a Chiefs game since late September. Much like Donna, who sported a Chiefs jersey underneath a black jacket, <a href=#>the Grammy winner</a>, 33, donned a Chiefs jacket over a black tank top. She completed her look with gold accessories, a ponytail and her <a href=#>signature red lip</a>.</p><p>Swift also spent time <a href=#>hanging out with Travis’ dad</a>, <a href=#><strong>Ed Kelce</strong></a>, in a suite at Arrowhead Stadium. Ed and Donna — who divorced after roughly 25 years of marriage — also share son <a href=#><strong>Jason Kelce</strong></a>, who plays for the Philadelphia Eagles.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Brittany Mahomes</strong></a> (née Matthews) — the wife of Chiefs quarterback <a href=#><strong>Patrick Mahomes</strong></a> — also <a href=#>watched the Thursday match</a> with Swift and the Kelces. She was photographed hugging the “Anti-Hero” singer after a successful play.</p><p>Brittany, 28, was also <a href=#>one of several celebs</a> who joined Swift at<a href=#> the Chiefs October 1 game</a> against the New York Jets. The musician’s famous pals <a href=#><strong>Sabrina Carpenter</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Blake Lively</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Hugh Jackman</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Sophie Turner</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Shawn Levy</strong></a>, and her brother, <strong>Austin Swift</strong>, joined her to cheer Travis, 34, and his team to victory.</p><p>Travis later revealed on the October 4 episode of his and Jason’s “New Heights” podcast that Donna was <a href=#>“on top of the f—king world”</a> after meeting Taylor’s celeb squad at the October 1 game, at which she sat next to actor <a href=#><strong>Kevin Miles</strong></a> (a.k.a. Jake from State Farm).</p><p>Travis first sparked romance rumors with Taylor after he attempted to <a href=#>give her a friendship bracelet</a> with his number on it at one of her July <a href=#>Eras Tour</a> shows. “I was disappointed that she doesn’t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings,” he later told Jason <a href=# rel=noopener>on “New Heights.”</a> “So I was a little butthurt I didn’t get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Donna-Kelce-Sports-Taylor-Swift-Inspired-Bracelets-at-Chiefs-Game-1.jpg><p>After Jason <a href=#>refused to comment</a> on his brother’s love life during a September postgame interview, Taylor added fuel to the relationship fire by <a href=#>attending the Chiefs’ game</a> against the Chicago Bears later that month.</p><p>“Taylor’s really enjoying getting to know Travis,” a source exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> on October 3. “They’re taking it day by day, but she has high hopes. She likes that he’s a normal, nice guy. He’s down-to-earth and isn’t affected by fame. She also thinks he’s hot.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>One day before the Chiefs’ Thursday game, Taylor stepped out solo at the Los Angeles premiere for her <a href=#>The Eras Tour movie</a>. As she continues to make NFL match appearances, NFL broadcaster <strong>Al Michaels</strong> revealed that he and other sports commentators have discussed <a href=#>how much coverage</a> to give the “Karma” singer.</p><p>“You can’t make a sideshow the show,” Michaels, 78, told <a href=# rel=noopener>Sports Illustrated</a> on Thursday. “The vast majority of the audience are tuning in to watch a football game. There are people, I don’t know how many, it could be a sizable number, but it’s certainly not a majority, that if you trained the camera on her all night long, they’d be satisfied with that. This is not what we’re doing to do.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadp56jrm63xKWanmWjpbyzwNJmq5qxnKS%2Fbr%2FWop2tZZmjwLG10Z6bZpqilrCmuMStqmaZpGKwqbXEn6pmn5GisnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-films-that-will-leave-you-wondering-what-the-hell-just-happened.html><span>←</span><span>15 Films That Will Leave You Wondering What The Hell Just Happened</span></a>
