However, knowing the opulent life Culpo is used to, fans are curious to know<strong> how much McCaffrey is being paid annually by the NFL.</strong> McCaffrey, who was drafted to the NFL to play for the Panthers in 2017, now plays for the San Francisco 49ers and is literally making history with his new contract.</p><p>One thing is for certain - Olivia Culpo seems interested in dating guys who are undeniably financially secure. Judging from her last few relationships, she likes her men of a certain status, and McCaffrey certainly fits the bill. Let's find out what Christian McCaffrey's annual NFL salary is, how it funds the lavish lifestyle he enjoys with Olivia Culpo, and what her net worth really is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-christian-mccaffrey-paid-annually-to-fund-his-lifestyle-with-olivia-culpo>What Is Christian McCaffrey Paid Annually To Fund His Lifestyle With Olivia Culpo?</h2><p>Christian McCaffrey isn't the first professional athlete Olivia Culpo has dated, but he's the first one to have recently signed a contract that makes him the NFL's highest-paid running back. According to Yahoo Life, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">McCaffrey signed a four-year, $64 million contract </a></strong>extension with the Carolina Panthers, which will go through to 2025. However, in 2022, he was traded to the San Francisco 49ers, and renegotiated his deal in 2023, placing <strong>his salary for 2024 at $11.8 million and $12 million for 2025</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/untitled-design-11.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Christian McCaffrey's annual salary for 2024 alone is more than Culpo's entire net worth, </strong>which is believed to be around $9 million. Despite being a few years older than McCaffrey (27), Culpo (31) had agreed to make things official with the young NFL star after the couple got engaged in April 2023. This definitely wasn't a rushed decision, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the couple had been dating for four years prior,</a> according to People.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/olivia-culpo-s-relationship-with-christian-mccaffrey-differs-from-her-thing-with-nick-jonas-in-these-notable-ways-include-all-three-please.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Olivia Culpo's Relationship With Christian McCaffrey Differs From Her Thing With Nick Jonas In These Notable Ways</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Olivia Culpo has famously dated Nick Jonas and Christian McCaffrey but she describes both relationships very differently.</span><p>As aforementioned, <a href=#>Olivia Culpo's relationship history</a> has been more about quality than quantity, and so far, it seems that Christian McCaffrey qualifies as the best candidate. According to Pro Football Network, it seems that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Culpo believed the location was ideal</a> because she felt that it was "A respite from the city."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-does-christian-mccaffrey-spend-his-nfl-salary>How Does Christian McCaffrey Spend His NFL Salary?</h2><p>Beginning with one of the biggest investments of his life, <strong>Christian McCaffrey bought an engagement ring for Olivia Culpo </strong>that cost over half a million dollars. Although it won't make the list of <a href=#>the most expensive celebrity engagement rings ever purchased</a>, it is definitely a pretty penny compared to what the average American spends. According to The Richest, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">McCaffrey designed the ring himself</a> - "a brilliant-cut oval 8-carat center stone diamond ring accompanied with Cadillac or Epaulette diamond side stones in a trilogy design set in platinum." The exact price of <strong>the engagement ring is registered at over $621,000.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/olivia-culpo-and-christian-mccaffrey.jpg><p>The diamond-studded ring is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the life of luxury that Christian McCaffrey will be sharing with Olivia Culpo. He has also been known for making lucrative real estate investments. Celebrity Net Worth tells us that he bought a condo in Charlotte, North Carolina in 2019 for $2 million, then sold it for $3 million in 2023. In 2020, he purchased another property in North Carolina for $7.5 million and sold it for $12.5 million in 2024.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Real estate isn't the only way Christian McCaffery puts his money to work for him in order to maintain the standard of living for himself and Olivia Culpo. He has also been praised for his strategic investments in companies like Pair Eyewear, which specializes in children's eyewear, and Hyperice, which provides technology for athlete recovery. Both of his investments have yielded lucrative returns, which highlights McCaffrey's business-savvy mindset when it comes to wealth accumulation and long-term financial security.</p><h3 id=who-has-olivia-culpo-dated-before-her-engagement-to-christian-mccaffery>Who Has Olivia Culpo Dated Before Her Engagement To Christian McCaffery?</h3><p>Olivia Culpo has always been in the company of powerful and wealthy men, regardless of whether they were a romantic interest. And why would anyone expect differently from the former Miss Universe? She has opened up about the expectations she had for her love life in an interview with People Stylewatch in 2022. She said, "I always thought by 30 I would be married [and] I'd have kids... I was with somebody that did really horrible, horrible things." Here are a few of the people she's been connected to in the past:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li>Nick Jonas (dated from 2013-2015)</li><li>Ryan Lochte (plutonic relationship)</li><li>Tim Tebow (2015)</li><li>Danny Amendola (dated from 2016-2018)</li><li>Zedd (2019)</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/untitled-design-13.png><p>Two of the names in the list above are NFL players (Tim Tebow, Danny Amendola), which is why it's no surprise that Olivia Culpo found her way into the arms of Christian McCaffrey. However, it appears that she had a special connection with Nick Jonas, who she believed herself to be in love with. She even confessed to believing that she and Jonas would get married one day, but the two eventually split.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-olivia-culpo-39-s-net-worth>What Is Olivia Culpo's Net Worth?</h2><p>Although Olivia Culpo rose to fame while competing in beauty pageants, subsequently leading her to become Miss Universe, she's much more than a pretty face. <strong>She has amassed a net worth of $9 million</strong>, much of which she makes as a social media personality and influencer on platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram. She is paid generously through partnerships with brands such as L'Oréal, Uberliss, and Kipling for endorsing their products on her social media platforms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/untitled-design-12.png><p>Christian McCaffrey is much richer than Olivia Culpo when comparing her $9 million to his $30 million net worth. But that doesn't mean that she won't stop providing for herself.
