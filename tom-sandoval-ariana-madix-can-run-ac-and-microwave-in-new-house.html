Luckily for them, the farmhouse-style, five-bedroom, five-and-a-half-bathroom house they recently purchased in the Valley Village area of Los Angeles’ San Fernando Valley is newly built and functions just fine.</p><p>“Ariana is so happy. It’s so great,” Sandoval told Us. “It’s a big, beautiful house. We saw a lot of houses, and this one had definitely the nicest finishes. It has pocket doors, so it fully opens up. Indoor-outdoor living space. It’s got a pool, jacuzzi. It’s so sexy.”</p><p>The Bravo personalities turned to one of the TomTom Bar co-owners’ longtime pals during the search for their perfect house.</p><p>“One of my best friends, Doug [McFarland], we grew up together. I’ve known him since I was 3 years old, and he just happens to be in real estate, so he’s my real estate agent,” Sandoval explained. “I definitely trust him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Tom-Sandoval-and-Ariana-Madix.jpg><p>The St. Louis native told Us that he and Madix, 33, have been working “well together” while decorating and furnishing their new digs.</p><p>“Ariana’s definitely pretty good,” he said about his girlfriend of four years, whom he began dating in 2014 after splitting from their costar and former SUR coworker <a href=#><strong>Kristen Doute</strong></a>. “She’s more about the overall aesthetic. … I’ll be like, ‘I just want that art piece or that chair,’ and she helps incorporate it.”</p><p>One thing that Sandoval is doing on his own is building a bar inside the house. “I’m gonna be starting a podcast and I’m gonna have it at the bar in our place,” he revealed to Us. “We have a lot of stuff going on.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Vanderpump Rules airs on Bravo Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatp51iwKK6w6itmqRdlr%2Bqrc2aZKaZlJ7Fbq%2FAp2SrrZ5irqR5wKebZqWZmL%2Bww8CvnGahnmK7psOMoaauq5Vk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./richest-sports-families-rival-david-and-victoria-beckhams-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>These Sports Families Almost Rival David And Victoria Beckham's Outlandish Combined Net Worth</span></a>
