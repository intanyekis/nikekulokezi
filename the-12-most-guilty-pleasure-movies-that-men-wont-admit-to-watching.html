Twelve&nbsp;being the least popular and one&nbsp;being the most popular. This list is comprehensive. Not all men are bench-pressing 300 pounds in the gym twice a week or pounding down beers while picking up chicks at a bar. And even the men that do can end up feeling not far from a character or a scene in a chick flick because it doesn’t matter how much testosterone you have.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After listening to all the stories told to me, I’ve learned a few things: sometimes men end up identifying with the characters in a movie they thought they would hate. There’s a long list of "girl movies" which a lot of men actually do enjoy watching every now and then. Some of the more extreme cases include men who will watch one of these movies for weeks on end. And I’ll go through all the reasons for this spectacle.</p><p>In everyday life, things like this don’t get talked about because we don’t have time to show you how much we love a certain chick flick. There’s no time for that; not out loud in public or around friends. That gets our man-card pulled. But now you’ll know the secret: what we see in these movies which women may not see and why we may actually like a chick flick.</p><p>Here are&nbsp;The 12 Most Guilty Pleasure Movies That Men Won’t Admit To Watching.</p><h2 id=12-how-to-lose-a-guy-in-10-days><strong>12. How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days</strong></h2><p>Via www.cosmopolitan.co.id</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some dudes say <a href=#>Kate Hudson</a> and <a href=#>Matthew McConaughey</a> had undeniable chemistry together. I could care less. But in most romantic comedies you’re just focused on the guy and the gal. But this movie was about more than the two main characters. It was funny too.</p><p>It’s watchable to guys because the movie’s about strategy. It’s not that lovey-dovey when you think about it; there’s a logical, chess game-like approach to the thing. And this all plays out in the shadows throughout the movie. And guys can dig that type of stuff. So you see, it’s not about romance at all; at least, it doesn’t start out that way. It starts out as being about manipulation. Stuff like that. And yeah, they fall in love but there’s many levels to the movie happening throughout the film. And we like that.</p><p></p><h2 id=11-love-actually><strong>11. Love Actually</strong></h2><p>Via hdmag.cz</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is a huge favorite among men. It’s easy to relate to. There’s plenty of eye-candy. And the many story lines weave in to each other well. A lot of people watch this in groups of guys and gals. But I’ll tell you, some dudes cry while watching it alone. It’s hard to image girls laughing to this the way I laugh. It’s got a lot of guy humor in it. It’s bold, quick, and blunt.</p><p>Actually it's a little disgusting to think that girls sit around and watch this movie. Some of the scenes are for dudes. The first couple of movies on this list will be a little hard for guys to sit through. This one isn’t hard at all. It’s a dumb movie and that’s a good thing.</p><p></p><h2 id=10-10-things-i-hate-about-you><strong>10. 10 Things I Hate About You</strong></h2><p>Via beta.l2am.com</p><p>Based on Shakespeare’s play "The Taming of the Shrew," there’s actually a good story here in 10 Things I Hate About You. It’s comedy, drama, and teen-romance all mixed up in one. The movie’s director, <a href=#>Gil Junger</a>, did a great job. The script is well-written, clever, and interesting. This was <a href=#>Heath Ledger’s</a> first major movie role as a leading actor. Also joining the cast were the young versions of <a href=#>Joseph Gordon-Levitt</a> and <a href=#>Julia Stiles</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There’s quite a bit more famous people I could list, but it would take up the entire paragraph. So here you have a movie filled with many actors and actresses you already know as young people. There was something different about movies in the 90s; they required more patience, they weren’t all about the spectacle, the acting was better, and the story was more important.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-p-s-i-love-you><strong>9. P.S. I Love You</strong></h2><p>Via whatwouldtotowatch.com</p><p>This movie is about a widow. It’s philosophical. It has elements to it which every guy can relate to like moving on, starting again, facing fear and the inevitable, and pushing through hard times. I like this movie because it transcends life and death. So we’re talking about something with deep meaning. This fact alone elevates P.S. I Love You into a status higher than chick flick or “rom com" for that matter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some guys say they cried after watching this. But I don’t cry. Especially not after watching movies. But this movie connects with who we are deep down inside: we're the knight in shining armor. Again, there is a strategic element. Gerry (<a href=#>Gerard Butler</a>) shows here that men are smart. The dude was thinking 10 steps ahead! And in the end he proved that we can protect our woman, even from beyond the grave! And that’s why… we watch it!</p><p></p><h2 id=8-the-princess-bride><strong>8. The Princess Bride</strong></h2><p>Via www.imagozone.com</p><p>There’s violence and grit. Loyalty, "true love," and honor. Different from the other movies on this list - somewhere between chick flick and&nbsp;drama.</p><p>Princess Bride has so many great lines. Almost every other line is quotable, the most famous being, "<a href=#>Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die</a>.” Doesn’t sound like a chick flick does it? The corny vibes come from the result of this movie's production year - circa 1987. Yeah, it's a classic. It features one of the greatest fencing scenes of all time, a full 3 minutes and 30 seconds of awesome. “The Man in Black” (<a href=#>Cary Elwes</a>) and Inigo Montoya (<a href=#>Mandy Patinkin</a>) put on an epic show. You’ve never seen two people act so cool while trying to kill each other. Should we still call this a chick flick? I say no.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-you-ve-got-mail><strong>7. You’ve Got Mail</strong></h2><p>Via www.movpins.com</p><p>Such a classic, respectable, and well-done film. Starring <a href=#>Tom Hanks</a> and <a href=#>Meg Ryan</a>. Although some may consider it a chick flick… it’s Tom Hanks! And <a href=#>Dave Chappelle</a> is hilarious as the best friend. Anything Tom Hanks does automatically upgrades the movie to awesome.</p><p>In You’ve Got Mail, Hanks represents the male perspective, stuck in the middle of a chick flick. He represents us all, every time he spouts a cynical view, a sarcastic line, or a dose of realism. And it’s all packaged up with a healthy dose of comedy. In the battle of the sexes, Hanks is our elected ambassador, fearlessly venturing into the land of chick flicks, and he was a good soldier.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-pitch-perfect><strong>6. Pitch Perfect</strong></h2><p>Via www.youtube.com</p><p>It’s kind of like Glee, only it's a movie. Most dudes are not into the musical, acappella, chick-group thing. In fact, the movie’s opening-week census consisted of 74% women. And yet, it’s a guilty pleasure for a large majority of dudes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Why? Well first, <a href=#>Adam DeVine</a> plays “Bumper.” DeVine makes this movie awesome. Bumper’s frequent witty comedy is akin to something you might find in a movie like Old School. And <a href=#>Rebel Wilson</a> as "Fat Amy" was hilarious. I mean come on! She calls herself "Fat Amy." That's entertaining in itself. Plus, from start to finish, the film highlights relevant issues such as growth and maturity. It navigates through the college social scene while still being able to make fun of itself. Pitch Perfect ends up being all-round fun and entertaining. And even though it’s about chicks, both dudes and dudettes can enjoy this movie.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-moulin-rouge><strong>5. Moulin Rouge</strong></h2><p>Via 1happyblog.com</p><p>Guys don’t usually go for musical productions or movies centered around lovey-dovey romance. Watching a "rom com" equals wasting time on something we don’t want to think about anyway. It’s like torture. But Moulin Rouge in some places can feel like you’re in the club; a gentlemen’s club that is. And it has gorgeous women, sex appeal, and the music isn’t half bad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some may call it a chick flick. But it feels like you’re right there in the middle of the Moulin Rouge in Paris. You may even be drinking. And the world on-screen blurs with the world of reality. And as you’re watching from your table, you’re definitely “slumming it.” Back in the day, the real Moulin Rouge was an exciting place. So why should the movie be any different? If businessmen, artists, workers, and more, loved the Moulin Rouge back then, why shouldn’t they love it now?</p><p></p><h2 id=4-the-devil-wears-prada><strong>4. The Devil Wears Prada</strong></h2><p>Via www.write2think.com</p><p>A naive girl meets the cold harsh world. This film reminds me of “State of Play” starring <a href=#>Russell Crowe</a>. Or am I crazy? Both films have many of the same elements. TDWP includes the older, more knowledgeable, Miranda Priestly (played by <a href=#>Meryl Streep</a>) as editor-in-chief and the naive, simple, just-graduated-from-college young lady-journalist Andrea Sachs (played by <a href=#>Anne Hathaway</a>).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And guess what happens in both movies? The young simple naive lady-journalist has to deal with a ruthless and isolated boss. She must learn to keep her values intact while adapting herself to the “real world.” The job is fast paced. And ruthless too. Don’t you think guys can relate to that? Andrea Sachs is also filled with ambition. Most men can relate to the idea of having to put your life on hold for your career and the consequential value-inventory which takes place.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-500-days-of-summer><strong>3. (500) Days of Summer</strong></h2><p>Via www.everystockphoto.com</p><p>People who give out relationship advice often cite this movie. Heck, people who give out life advice cite this movie. And I can't say this enough. A huge amount of Toms (the main character, Joseph Gordon-Levitt) exist in the world. That’s why guys watch this movie. It's about the one girl who will break your heart. And it always happens exactly the same way, every time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's about having those basic ideas about love and destiny, until she breaks them. We relate to the movie more than women do! Dr. NerdLove says “any guy past the age of 16 needs to be sat down with a copy of this movie and made to watch it from start to finish.” And I can’t say enough about the film's cinematography and the amazing acting.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-the-notebook><strong>2. The Notebook</strong></h2><p>Via www.usmagazine.com</p><p>Love it or hate it, The Notebook is what rom coms should look up to. If life was perfect, a lot of people would be Noah (<a href=#>Ryan Gosling</a>) or Allie (<a href=#>Rachel McAdams</a>). And the characters are well-developed; they have amazing chemistry together. And Rachel McAdams looks great. Some people put this in the class of "greatest love stories of all time."&nbsp;I don't know about that. But everyone loves or hates this movie! This is like explaining why people love food. It’s just a given. All the time. No one talks about food. You just get up and eat it when you want some. And it’s great! Why is this a chick flick? Because men don’t have anything to talk about with this movie. It's 100% romance novel. And men either watch this movie alone or with a girl.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=1-mean-girls><strong>1. Mean Girls</strong></h2><p>Via www.usmagazine.com</p><p>More men secretly love Mean Girls more than any other movie out there. It’s watchable, even if it’s really all about chicks. Once again, it’s all about strategy. And we can dig it. When I think back on my high school days, I don’t remember idealism, or melodramatic, mushy-gushy subject matter. I do remember hierarchy, social inclusion and exclusion, rules and by-laws, random betrayals, and animal-like psychology. It was all for the greater glory. Even if the greater glory was pure vanity, men can still relate to that.</p><p>And <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan</a> looked good in this movie. This was when she was like the girl next door, just coming into adulthood. In fact, Mean Girls was a huge reason for her fame. Why do you think she got famous in the first place? Because a whole bunch of dudes were watching this movie.</p><p><strong>Sources:</strong><a href=#>www.imdb.com</a><a href=#>www.nymag.com</a><a href=#>www.ew.com</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZq2glWJ%2Bc3nMqKqtZZeqtq3A2GanpZ2RqMKzsYympq%2Bhlah6tbTArWSmnZ5ixLC602aYnaWZqXq1u4ywmK2bmJ67qHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./saucey-austin.html><span>←</span><span>Saucey Austin (TikToker) Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Weight, Dating, Girlfriend, Career, Net Worth, F</span></a>
