Rolling Stone stated in 2014 that “the whole scope of Nile Rodgers’ career is still hard to understand” despite his reputation for “chucking” guitar.</p><h2>Nile Rodgers Parents: Meet Beverly Goodman, Nile Rodgers, Sr.</h2><p>Beverly Goodman gave birth to Nile Gregory Rodgers Jr. on September 19, 1952 on New York City’s Lower East Side. Rodgers was born when she was 14 years old. Although he had a significant impact on his life, Nile Rodgers Sr., his real father, was rarely present when Rodgers was growing up. Before his passing in 1970, Rodgers only had a “handful” of encounters with him. Goodman wed Bobby Glanzrock in 1959; in his 2011 autobiography, Richard Rodgers referred to him as a “beatnik PhD, whose views had angles that would make Miles Davis question his cool.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKaZobJuvs6dnp6qo2K9or7Ep6usZZ2asrV5wZ6tnqqcrnqou86dpJqmXaO2rbGMq6adn5WnwG6%2F0Wg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meagan-good-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Meagan Good Net Worth How Much is Good Worth?</span></a>
