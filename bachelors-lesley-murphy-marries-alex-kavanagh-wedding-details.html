Looking forward to processing the last 24 hours of this incredible life at 35,000 ft #ToKavAndToHold.”</p><p>For his part, the Australia native <a href=#>shared his own message</a> about their engagement via Instagram.</p><p>“Been waiting a very long time for this special moment @lesleyannemurphy,” he penned. “After spending over 18 months together side by side traveling 25 plus countries, meeting her beautiful friends and family many times at various special family occasions, Lesley making the trip down under a few times to meet the family and spend quality time getting to know everyone. Life is pretty crazy when all the stars align and the right person comes into your life at the right time just when you need it. Never give up on love.”</p><p>Kavanagh continued to share his devotion to his fiancée in his lengthy post. “I knew I wanted to get to know Lesley more after our first interaction, this stunning ray of light with the kindest heart was single?! Not sure how this was humanly possible, but it was! LUCKY ME!” Kavanagh wrote. “I’ve been planning this proposal for months, from asking Lesley parents for permission, to finding the perfect ring and planning a pretty over the top proposal with 5 drones, 3 cinematographers, 3 photographers all capturing the moment … Lesley, I love you with all my heart and can’t wait to share the rest of our lives together.”</p><p>One year later, the Arkansas native and the DroneGear founder <a href=#>welcomed a baby girl</a>, Nora, in February 2021.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Meet our newest little valentine,” Murphy <a href=#>captioned the Instagram carousel of images</a> of the newborn at the time. “I find her so perfect that sometimes words fail me and I’m left in tears instead … like right now.
