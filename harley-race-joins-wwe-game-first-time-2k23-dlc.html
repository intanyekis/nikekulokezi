WWE 2K23's third DLC pack might well be its most special to date as even though it will make five more Superstars playable in-game, one of them is an icon making his WWE video game debut.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=harley-race-in-wwe-2k23>Harley Race In WWE 2K23</h2><p>That man is Harley Race. Yes, despite the long and decorated career the late Hall of Famer enjoyed, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Giant Bomb</a>, Race has never been playable in a WWE game. That includes everything from the likes of WWF No Mercy, and even before that, to the current run of 2K games. Race was a playable character in the Legends of Wrestling series which ended in 2004.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>WWE 2K23 Patch Adds Multi-Person Title Matches To MyGM</a></span></p><p>Joining WWE 2K23 via The Race To NXT DLC pack, the former King of the Ring winner comes with four other Superstars, all of whom currently ply their trade in NXT. Anyone with access to the latest pack will also get Wendy Choo, Ivy Nile, Trick Williams, and Tony D'Angelo, all making their respective WWE video game debuts along with Race.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-race-to-nxt>The Race To NXT</h2><p>The Race To NXT DLC is the third of five announced packs that will continue to be rolled out over the summer. Kicking off in April, the first lot of WWE 2K23 DLC <a href=#>added The Steiners and Hit Row to the game</a>. Those two teams were <a href=#>followed by Pretty Deadly, Gallows & Anderson, and Tiffany Stratton</a> last month.</p><p>If you want any of the prior, present, or future 2K23 DLC packs, you need to have bought one of the deluxe editions of the game or its season pass. If you don't want to splash out on all of the DLC at once since it doesn't all appeal to you, the packs can be bought separately as they're released. Even if you have none of the above, <a href=#>WWE 2K added Candice LeRae</a> and <a href=#>Mia Yim to the game's roster</a> via a free update last month.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmeYlr%2BtsdhmqZqblWK3sLXNrGSwr5VitKK5xGadoqqjqXq1tcyeZGujYmh6pbjCaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tanzanian-in-court-for-occupying-ex-pepsi-boss-house-in-machakos.html><span>←</span><span>Tanzanian in Court for Occupying Ex-Pepsi Boss House in Machakos</span></a>
