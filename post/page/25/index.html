I’m sittin’ in my room, I’m starin’ out my window
And I wonder where you’ve gone
Thinking back on the happy hours just before the dawn
Outside the wind is blowin’

Where have you gone City streets and lonely highways
I travel down
My car is empty and the radio just seems to bring me down
I’m just tryin’ to find me
A pretty smile that I can get into</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who Does Elizabeth End Up With on When Calls the Heart? Lucas or Nathan?</h2><time>Aug 5, 2024</time>
