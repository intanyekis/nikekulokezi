The home is reportedly the first home that both Prince Harry and Meghan had ever owned.</p><p>After two years of living in the home, Prince Harry and Meghan are undertaking renovations, including fixing pipes. Both share an office where a single desk is placed in front of a fireplace that has two plush club chairs placed side by side facing into the room like thrones.</p><p><strong><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Most Expensive Pieces Of Jewelry Inside Meghan Markle's Collection</a></span></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There’s also a sitting room that features a grand piano gifted to the couple by actor and director Tyler Perry as a housewarming present. (Prince Harry and Meghan spent the coronavirus lockdown in 2020 living in Perry’s multimillion-dollar Beverly Hills mansion.) That space also includes cozy chairs and rosewater candles from Soho House—an establishment whose founder, Nick Jones, is a friend of Meghan’s. (It’s said that Prince Harry and Meghan were set up on a blind date at a Soho House in London.)</p><p>According to the article report in <a href=#>The Cut, “The Montecito house is the kind of big that startles you into remembering that unimaginable wealth is actually someone’s daily reality.”</a></p><p>Meghan Markle and Prince Harry initially avoided visiting this home before buying it, but eventually toured it—the outside only. The exterior features additionally include a chicken coop, a pool and a pool house and even two palm trees joined together at the bottom that Prince Harry said reminded him of himself and Meghan — telling the broker they were interested.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We did everything we could to get this house,” Meghan told the outlet. “Because you walk in and go … Joy.

You feel free.”</p><p><strong><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Nicest Celeb Houses In California You Need To See To Believe</a></span></strong></p><p>The home reportedly has an elevator, a chef’s kitchen with a butler’s pantry, a billiards room with a wet bar, and a gym. It also has a spa with massage rooms and a wine cellar.</p><p><a href=#>The Cut</a> reports that the couple won’t visit the Queen at Balmoral Castle in Scotland during a trip to the United Kingdom next week, according to the Daily Mail. The highly publicized “family rift is getting worse, not better.” Increased tensions include concerns over what Prince Harry will publish in an impending biography.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Vanessa Bryant Will Donate Her $16 Million Award from the Lawsuit Winnings To The Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=#>The Cut</a>, <a href=#>Newyork Post</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS2r8DEq62inadivKd5zJ6eoZmeYrqivsqlnGaZkqTCtXnHnqlmaWRig3Z5zKKjpaGfo3qxrcuaq6KZnGK1sMHSnmSipl2Yrq21xaipp6GRZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./doja-cat-responds-hating-fans-being-satanic-1234834124.html><span>←</span><span>Doja Cat Responds To Reports Of &amp;quot;Hating&amp;quot; Her Fans, Being Satanic</span></a>
