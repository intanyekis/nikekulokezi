It’s all from Amazon and it’s arriving over the weekend while I’m here, so God knows what I’m gonna look like.”</p><p class=p1>Adele — who performs <a href=#>her “Weekends With Adele” residency</a> in Sin City on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays — then pointed out one concertgoer was making her rethink her aversion to the metallic hue. “I said I didn’t like it [but] I absolutely love it [on you],” she gushed to the fan. “I do like that [you’re wearing] though; the arms are great!”</p><p class=p1>Beyoncé, 41, previously asked her fans to <a href=#>wear their shiniest silver outfits</a> for her remaining August and September tour dates, in honor of her Monday, September 4, birthday.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Adele-Panic-Bought-Glitter-Ball-Clothes-on-Amazon-at-3-AM-for-Beyonce-s-Renaissance-Tour.-2.jpg><p class=p1>“Virgo season is upon us,” the “Cuff It” singer wrote in a note posted on her website last month. “This tour has been such a joy and as we approach the last month, my birthday wish is to celebrate with you<a href=#> wearing your most fabulous silver fashions</a> to the shows 8.23 – 9.22! We’ll surround ourselves in a shimmering human disco ball each night. Everybody mirroring each other’s joy. Virgo season together in the House of Chrome.”</p><p class=p1>The dress code was<a href=#> a breeze for some members of the BeyHive</a> — like <a href=#><strong>Meghan Markle</strong></a>, who <a href=#>chose a SPRWMN sequined skirt</a> for the Friday, September 1, concert — to follow, while others admittedly struggled.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I’ve been told by a fairly reliable source that Beyoncé wants everyone coming to see her on Labor Day to wear silver clothes,” <a href=#><strong>Rosie O’Donnell</strong></a> said <a href=#>in an August TikTok video</a>. “I don’t have silver clothes. Does anyone know where I can get silver clothes to wear? I mean, like, a silver shirt maybe?”</p><p class=p1>She continued: “I <a href=#>want to be a part of the cool kids</a>. I don’t wanna disobey the Queen Bey, you know what I’m saying? I’m looking for silver clothes. … I’ve never seen [Beyoncé] perform, and I’ve been a fan of hers forever. She was on my show a bunch of times, and she’s a delicious human being. I think she’s super talented, and I can’t wait.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5axprjEZpmorZedwW6%2FyKWtnqpdpMK1ssitZKimXZa6osbOp2SlmaOpeq61za6rnmWWpL9ursSypqeblWKwsLrCnqmtZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-stephane-tapie-learn-everything-about-bernard-tapies-son.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Stphane Tapie?
