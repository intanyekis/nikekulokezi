It has been alleged that O’Bannon and Harlow were admitted to the restaurant without going through regular security protocols.</p><p>This is yet another tragic incident involving guns in an unexpected setting, and All too often we hear of these senseless tragedies occurring throughout our communities.</p><p>On the night before the 2021 Kentucky Derby, Danny Nash and Alex O’Bannon were at a nightclub in Louisville.&nbsp;</p><p>While there, Nash “violently attacked” O’Bannon two times, as witnessed by multiple bystanders and captured on camera.</p><p>O’Bannon is a DJ for rapper Jack Harlow, who was performing at the same club that evening and standing just feet away from where the altercation occurred.&nbsp;</p><p>The incident began with a brief exchange of words between a man and woman that quickly escalated into violence when shots were fired, sending ushers and customers scrambling to leave the building.</p><p>This shocking incident marks yet another example of the unpredictability of armed conflict in our society.</p><p>Nash took up a sizable bottle of liquor, grabbed the back of O’Bannon’s shirt, and hit him twice in the head with the bottle.</p><p>She then pushed her way onto the stage, moving closer to O’Bannon, and “started physically hitting (him) again from atop the stage, causing the crowd to scream in protest.”</p><p>Authorities have not disclosed any information regarding the circumstances that may have led to the shooting. Still, sources told WHAS 11 that Nash confronted O’Bannon about his alleged role in a 2020 shooting that claimed the life of her friend Torre Cortez Foree.</p><p>A defence lawyer for the DJ accused of killing a nightclub waitress in Louisville last May has begged a judge to spare his client from prosecution, claiming Ronnie O’Bannon shot the lady in self-defence.</p><p>According to the defence, Nash allegedly struck O’Bannon in the head with a champagne bottle. He denied murder and evidence tampering, claiming self-defence in the incident.</p><p>The DJ who killed the Louisville server acted in self-defence, so he should not be prosecuted.</p><p>According to a request submitted by O’Bannon’s defence lawyer Steve Romines, a bartender assaulted the defendant, who had a court appearance set for him.</p><p>The Kentucky Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control found after an investigation that Nash, who wasn’t working that night, thought O’Bannon killed her companion at the Shively club.</p><p>According to Harlow, O’Bannon was not working for him, he was unaware that O’Bannon was carrying a gun, and he had nothing to do with the altercation or the shooting.</p><p>Harlow expressed his “heart is shattered for Nash and everyone else touched by this awful death” in a message on his Instagram page.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Witness</h2><p>The security checks are designed to ensure the safety of club patrons by preventing people with bad intentions from entering.&nbsp;</p><p>However, according to the complaint made by someone who was present when a shooting occurred, Harlow and O’Bannon managed to enter without passing through these security checks.&nbsp;</p><p>This fact has been highlighted in three separate cases so far and if successful in their compensation claim, it could lead to accountability for those responsible for such gross negligence of safety procedures.</p><p>The outcome of this allegation against Harlow and O’Bannon could pave the way for more transparency and strict enforcement at clubs across the country.</p><p>On the night of May 1, Brittany Black was in a club when her friend Nash became embroiled in an altercation with another person.&nbsp;</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Black claims that Nash “reached out” and before anyone could react, hundreds of innocent people witnessed the shooter pull out a gun and take aim.</p><p>The gun went off and Nash’s friend was shot by the other person.&nbsp;</p><p>This malicious act played out for everyone to see in one horrifying moment that altered their lives forever.&nbsp;</p><p>While all of the details are still being investigated, what is known for certain is that a woman was shot in broad daylight by a man and his gun in front of hundreds of people who will never be able to forget what they saw as long as they live.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>O’Bannon Suspected as a Murderer</h2><p>Ronnie Tyshon O’Bannon, also known as Ronnie Lucciano, has reportedly been charged with murder and tampering with physical evidence about a shooting that occurred on May 1 at Vibes Restaurant and Ultra Lounge while Harlow was enjoying Kentucky Derby weekend.</p><p>Ronnie O’Bannon is accused of killing bartender Kasmira Nash at Vibes Restaurant and Ultra Lounge during Derby weekend in 2021.</p><p>O’Bannon’s preliminary hearing was moved to December, and he is still held at home.</p><p>More time was needed to review the more than 297 pages of discovery, which included images, recordings, and 911 calls from the night of Nash’s death, according to the commonwealth and Steve Romines, O’Bannon’s lawyer, who both stated this in court.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Families of Victims</h2><p>The families of both victims are still waiting. Christina Malone said at the last check, ballistics still weren’t processed.</p><p>She said police told her the delays had nothing to do with the fact that O’Bannon is the DJ for Harlow, the famous Louisville rapper, and was standing right next to O’Bannon when the shooting happened.</p><p>Kasmira Nash, 37, was shot while working as a bartender at Vibes and died because the event was partially captured on camera.</p><p>According to reports, Nash was found dead at the site along with another man who had minor injuries.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC2wJyiZqCRp7mww4ydoWalpaexpr6O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./leonardo-dicaprio-takes-private-jet-to-accept-environmental-award-w207368.html><span>←</span><span>Leonardo DiCaprio Takes Private Jet to Accept Environmental Award</span></a>
