In an interview released Tuesday (Nov. 17), Phife recalled a conversation with the Tribe’s label Jive about issues regarding the clearing of the sample.
“I don’t think they cleared the sample, and instead of Lou Reed saying, ‘You can’t use it,’ he said, ‘Y’all can use it, but I get all the money from that…to this day, we haven’t seen a dime from that song."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

There have never been any hard feelings towards the now-deceased singer, but Phife says he wishes the record label was a bit more careful with processing and clearing the sample with its owner.</p><p>“I’m grateful that [the song] kicked in the door, but to be honest, that was the label’s fault. They didn’t clear the sample,” he says. “And rightfully so. It’s his art; it’s his work. He could have easily said no. There could have easily been no ‘Can I Kick It?’ So you take the good with the bad. And the good is, we didn’t get sued. We just didn’t get nothing from it.”</p><p>The Tribe recently <a href=#>reunited</a>&nbsp;on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon to perform “Can I Kick It?” in celebration to the 25th anniversary of their debut album.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5Z6tb7Im5xmm5GhuaawjKqsnqukYrmwwYyrnJ6cXZiur3nIZqKim5titrV50pqkqaSVYoB5g5Jxbmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./90210-cast-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>90210 Cast Net Worth Richest Cast Members Salary</span></a>
