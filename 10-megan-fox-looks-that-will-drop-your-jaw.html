Whether it's walking out on a sunny day with her baby bump proudly displayed or walking on the red carpet at Cannes, the actress has loads and loads of "oomph" and the oh so very enviable "Wow factor." This woman has it all in her bag.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Megan Fox is so popular thanks to her undeniable&nbsp;beauty and sex appeal, and websites have been driven mad due to her overexposure. Well that’s the star power this proud mom of two children has accumulated over the course of her career.</p><p>Fox&nbsp;is larger than life but here we turn our microscopes on and have our imaginations focus entirely on her wardrobe. Yes! Whatever she wears is in the news, and seldom does she go wrong. Here we pick the top 10 jaw dropping looks from among the gazillion times she has mesmerized us.</p><h2 id=10-megan-s-legs-at-jennifer-s-body><strong>10. Megan’s Legs at Jennifer’s Body</strong></h2><p>Seldom does it happen that the screening event garners more eyeballs than the movie itself. The horror flick <a href=#>Jennifer’s Body</a>’s screening was one such instance, thanks to the lead star Megan Fox’s appearance in a black dress which was as tantalizing as the legs it partly didn’t intend to cover.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What made this dress stand out was the combination of the subtlety of black color and the slanted slit look it bore. The part of the dress that partially covered her&nbsp;cleavage was the starting point of that slit, and it made the dress exude WOW factor.&nbsp;The waist band gave it a touch of femininity complimenting the overall look of the dress.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-hot-purple><strong>9. Hot Purple</strong></h2><p>Few exist in this world who can make absolutely anything&nbsp;look sexy. Megan Fox has a penchant for being amongst those few. Her purple dress/skirt at the 2010 Teen Choice Awards in Hollywood definitely made heads turn around. Photographers went bonkers at the bombshell who despite wearing a dress that wasn’t as revealing as some of her other looks, managed to keep all eyes fixed on her. The shimmery greyish-blackish sort of skirt with prints was giving leeway to her legs as she put a hand on the surfboard. This dress was the real winner of the event.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-denim-fantasy><strong>8. Denim Fantasy</strong></h2><p>Megan can make anything look sexy. It’s her persona more than the clothes she wears that makes this happen. Denim is a staple worn by all, so there's nothing special about that. But when Megan wears something, it goes from bland to oh so awesome.&nbsp;Denim short shorts coupled with a very casual green tee with the brown belt that was left a bit loose, intentionally enabling the loose look&nbsp;of the t-shirt to blend in with the skin hugging nature of the shorts, looked other worldly on the exotic megastar. It reiterates the fact that if you have it in you, even the ordinary looks sublime.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-glittering-in-gold><strong>7. Glittering in Gold</strong></h2><p>Although this was the 66th annual Golden Globe awards, the much awaited and most star studded show in the world where everyone has his/her eyes glued to see who wins the coveted golden statuette, it was Megan Fox whose starry gold dress became the talk of the town.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To get a Golden Globe is an honor for which people extremely hard. Everyone invited dresses to impress,&nbsp;but Megan leaves things to our imaginations. Pulling off a glittering gold-colored dress at an event where everyone is predominantly wearing&nbsp;black is quite an achievement, but not for Megan. She has the habit of donning extraordinary looks and making it look completely effortless.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-classy-in-white><strong>6. Classy in White</strong></h2><p>A flowing single shoulder strap gown in white is the epitome of sophistication. It reminds us of the persona of Greek Gods. Hair slicked back, Megan is looking ravishing in this dress. We all love gowns, as they never go out of fashion, but what makes this one stand out from the lot is its sleek look and the flowing silhouette. The dangling earrings add to the femininity of this outfit which Megan sported at the Los Angeles premiere of her movie Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-the-woven-interlude><strong>5. The Woven Interlude</strong></h2><p>Pair a woven half sleeve net dress with a black contrasting inner part of the dress, add to the mix a woman who is innately enticing, and you get a look to die for. Sporting an open hair look with minimal makeup, Megan has kept it quite simple here but the style statement is not taken down even a single notch. It gives off a soft look and makes Megan look beautiful and innocent. It’s an understatement to call her beautiful, but it’s just the word that suits her in this self-contained style.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-dressed-to-the-nines><strong>4. Dressed to the Nines</strong></h2><p>In this one Megan is seen wearing a creamy white dress with linear silver embossed patterns. This dress is quite low giving us a hint of&nbsp;cleavage and that’s where the dress gets its X factor from. With a&nbsp;pack of fur at the shoulder and some flashy makeup, Megan looks ravishing at the Paramount Pictures Premiere of TRANSFORMERS, at Mann's Village Theatre in Los Angeles. One can notice that enviable waistline that millions of girls are willing to die for, but that’s what Megan has been all her career, i.e. “the aspiration.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=3-love-the-way-you-dress><strong>3. Love the Way You Dress</strong></h2><p>Very few people are deserving of being described as&nbsp;a visual spectacle, but Fox is. It seems that every element of her look is perfectly matching. One of the main highlights of this super look is Megan being dolled up to the max. As if her acting wasn’t enough to get her accolades, Megan’s look at this event was surreal amidst the glitz and glamor at the premiere of <a href=#>her movie This is 40</a>.</p><p>Those beautiful green eyes don’t pierce as they usually do, instead giving off a tantalizing feeling in tandem with the red lipstick and her tanned skin visible from between her&nbsp;flowing locks. Megan’s hair, parted down the middle, is what we like the most about this look. She sure knows how to blend in with the theme and still stand out.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2-hug-the-skin><strong>2. Hug the Skin</strong></h2><p>Skin-hugging pants always look hot and are the rage whenever they are worn by stars. <a href=#>Megan’s denim pants</a> with that short grey&nbsp;t-shirt hugging her upper body creates&nbsp;the perfect look for her part as April O'Neil in the summer blockbuster Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows. Her high heeled boots&nbsp;compliment the look perfectly and give TMNT fans yet another reason to check out the movie this summer. Megan must have made some jaws drop with this stunner.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-the-best-with-less><strong>1. The Best With Less</strong></h2><p>We have saved the best for the last. Megan’s look in this photo&nbsp;is one to die for. Tantalizing, mesmerizing, sexy, upbeat, there aren't enough words to describe how amazing she looks. This is the best look she has ever donned, as it leaves very little&nbsp;to a viewer’s imagination while remaining classy and not stepping over the edge. Yeah, we could examine this look&nbsp;all day and still not&nbsp;get enough of it. Megan, you just killed it this time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqaF2isqitzWadqLBdobywt9Jmq6GZpGLEqrjLZpurp6BixrDB0Wahmq9f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jules-laviscount-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-175185-html.html><span>←</span><span> Jules Laviscount</span></a>
