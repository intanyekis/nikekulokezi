Leo helped both events raise millions, donated his own funds, auctioned off his house and had speaking roles in both programs.”</p><p>DiCaprio, who has been an advocate for environmentalism for many years, famously used his acceptance speech at the 2016 Oscars in February to address the issue of climate change.</p><p>“Climate change is real,” he told the audience while accepting the Best Actor award for his role in <i>The Revenant</i>. “It is happening right now. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species. We need to work together to stop procrastinating. … Let us not take this planet for granted. I do not take tonight for granted.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/leonardo-dicaprio-may-19-1c6b3c03-5752-4ed9-ab15-b2a6957f00b2.jpg><p>In 2014, the <i>Wolf of Wall Street</i> star reportedly took six private jet fights in a six-week timespan. That same year, he also rented the world’s fifth largest yacht to watch the World Cup in Brazil.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Fans and critics alike took to social media on Friday to criticize the actor. Some users called him a hypocrite, while <a href=#>another noted</a>, “DiCaprio flies from Cannes to NYC in private jet for environmentalism award. If only his self-awareness were as big as his carbon footprint.”</p><span class=caption></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalnZ%2BjrrOwzmabopuRpb%2Bqu4ytmKSdo2K9s7XVmqueZZqawW7AzmaYnJuVpcFusc2voKunnqKyr8DApWSar5GnsW7DkWlubG5oZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jim-carrey-ginger-gonzaga-split-after-less-than-a-year-of-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Jim Carrey, Ginger Gonzaga Split After Less Than a Year of Dating</span></a>
