In the series of snaps, the Saltburn star stood next to Phoenix, 49, as they smiled and chatted.</p><p>Both Keoghan and Phoenix have taken on the role of the Joker in different interpretations of the Batman comics.</p><p>Phoenix starred as the title character in 2019’s Joker, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor. He will reprise the role in the upcoming sequel, Joker: Folie à Deux, which also stars <strong>Lady Gaga</strong> as fellow DC Comics villain Harley Quinn.</p><p>“There’s so many different ways of looking at it,” Phoenix said of his character portrayal during a 2019 <a href=# rel=noopener>Vanity Fair</a> interview. “You can either say here’s somebody who, like everybody, needed to be heard and understood and to have a voice. Or you can say this is somebody that disproportionately needs a large quantity of people to be fixated on him. His satisfaction comes as he stands in amongst the madness.”</p><p>Keoghan, for his part, was cast as the Joker in the 2022’s <strong>Robert Pattinson</strong>-led The Batman. While his scene didn’t officially make it into the movie, it was released on YouTube and promptly went viral with fans praising Keoghan’s performance.</p><p>Keoghan had submitted a self-tape for the character of The Riddler, but that role ultimately went to <strong>Paul Dano</strong>.</p><p>“The Batman wants you to play the Joker — but you cannot tell anyone,” Keoghan told <a href=# rel=noopener>GQ</a> when recalling a conversation with his team about the offer.</p><p>News of Keoghan’s casting wasn’t revealed until March 2022 when an “<a href=# rel=noopener>Unnamed Arkham Prisoner</a>” (how he was credited in the film) offered a bone-chilling laugh many fans identified as that of the Joker.</p><p>Though his scene was initially deleted, Keoghan put plenty of thought into his character. He described his iteration of the villain as someone who is “a bit charming and a bit hurt.”</p><p>“I wanted some sort of human in there behind the makeup,” he told GQ. “I want people to relate to him… [to know] this is a façade he puts on.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>When asked about reprising the role in the highly anticipated <a href=# rel=noopener>The Batman II</a>, Keoghan said he’d “love another crack” at the character.</p><p>“I’ve got a ton of back work done on him. If an opportunity does arise but, you know, they make the call, and I’ve got to respect that,” Keoghan said on the <a href=# rel=noopener>“Happy Sad Confused”</a> podcast in January 2023. “I’ve got a few other things I’d love to bring. Actually, I have this little half-Moleskin book I’ve written a lot in already and so yeah, I want to show people what that is.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmarJ2Wu262zqScq6tdl66zvthmop6nl52ur3nAp5tmop%2BWvra1zWanoaeVo7a5ecyenK1lkal6qLvLnZynZZehvKOx0mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anna-faris-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Anna Faris Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
