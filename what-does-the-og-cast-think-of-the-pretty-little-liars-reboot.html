Fans <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wondered if the OG cast would come back</a>&nbsp;and also questioned whether it's way too soon for a new version, since the series finale aired in June 2017. According to&nbsp;Variety, the new show will be called&nbsp;Pretty Little Liars: Original Sin and&nbsp;Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa,&nbsp;who has worked on&nbsp;Chilling Adventures of Sabrina&nbsp;and&nbsp;Riverdale, is behind it.</p><p>What has the cast of the original show&nbsp;said about this reboot? Let's take a look.</p><h2 id=lucy-hale-s-comments>Lucy Hale's Comments</h2><p>After&nbsp;Pretty Little Liars&nbsp;ended,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lucy Hale starred on Life Sentence and Katy Keene</a>, two shows that only got&nbsp;one season.</p><p>People definitely associate the star with her role as Aria Montgomery, so it makes sense that fans would wonder how she feels about the reboot.</p><p>Lucy Hale is the OG&nbsp;Pretty Little Liars&nbsp;star who has talked the most about the reboot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hale commented on the reboot news</a>&nbsp;and according to&nbsp;Us Weekly, she said, "I sincerely wish everyone the best and I hope it’s a huge success. Some people get angry about a reboot, but I think it’s important to be supportive of up-and-coming artists. I’m curious to see what they do with it!”</p><p>According to&nbsp;Entertainment Tonight,&nbsp;Hale actually brought up the idea of a spin-off or similar show in May 2020. When asked about a cast reunion, she explained,&nbsp;"I feel like they're gonna do a spinoff or something before then. I don't know. I'm so protective of this show. So I feel like when the time comes that they want to do it with a whole new cast, I might have to produce it because I'm way too protective of it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to&nbsp;Variety, the reboot will take place in a town called Millwood and feature high school girls who are being stalked and whose lives are at stake, which sounds very familiar to fans of the original series.</p><p>While on the original show, the main characters were hiding secrets that "A" and the "A Team" knew about, these new girls learn that their parents are the ones who have gotten them into trouble. The publication mentions that their parents were involved in "a secret sin"&nbsp;20 years before.&nbsp;According to Entertainment Tonight, HBO Max gave the reboot a direct-to-series order.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="'Pretty Little Liars': Here's Why Sasha Pieterse Lied About Her Age" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Pretty Little Liars': Here's Why Sasha Pieterse Lied About Her Age</a></span></p><h2 id=the-cast-s-opinions-and-some-fans>The Cast's Opinions (And Some Fans)</h2><p>Besides Lucy Hale, the rest of the cast of&nbsp;PLL&nbsp;doesn't seem to have said anything directly about the reboot, except in one instance.</p><p>They did say that they <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">would be happy to play their parts again</a>: according to&nbsp;Cheat Sheet, the cast had a reunion&nbsp;on the Looped&nbsp;app and they talked about this.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ian Harding, who portrayed Ezra Fitz, said, "I think if it does happen, it has to be pretty extreme." Sasha Pieterse, who played Alison DiLaurentis, said, "It wouldn’t be PLL without [death].”</p><p>Creator and showrunner I. Marlene King also responded to a fan who thought the reboot was too soon: they tweeted, "The bodies aren’t even cold yet and King replied, "Literally. They are somewhere in the WB jungle," according to&nbsp;Us Weekly.</p><p>What do fans think of the reboot? Many of them seem to agree that it's way too early to have another version of the series.</p><p>In a Reddit thread, a fan shared their thoughts: "I'm so over Hollywood with all these reboots." Another said that having a reboot in five to ten years would make more sense.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="'Pretty Little Liars' Fans Have A Wild Theory About Shay Mitchell's Baby Daddy" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Pretty Little Liars' Fans Have A Wild Theory About Shay Mitchell's Baby Daddy</a></span></p><p>While some fans think it's too soon for a&nbsp;PLL&nbsp;reboot, it will definitely be interesting to see what the reboot is like and how this new mystery evolves.</p><p>The series finale of the show was incredibly dramatic and intense. "A.D." was revealed and it turned out that Spencer Hastings had an evil twin, Alex Drake.</p><p>In an interview with&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter, I. Marlene King shared that she was hopeful that viewers loved the final episode.</p><p>King explained, "I’ve always thought, in large part, that the vision we had as the writers on the show — and myself as the creator — was clearly in line with what the fans wanted. You know, we’re fangirls too, we love the show. I’m the biggest fangirl of Pretty Little Liars there is! So if I’m true to myself, it usually works out that most people are happy, and I knew that all of our fans don’t agree either. There’s a lot of ‘shipping wars online and whatnot, so I just hope that those people were satisfied."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Is ‘Gossip Girl’ Based On Real People?</a></span></p><p>While Lucy Hale has spoken out about the&nbsp;Pretty Little Liars&nbsp;reboot, it doesn't seem like the rest of the OG cast has had too much to say about it.</p><p>After two spin-offs that only got one season (Ravesnwood&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Perfectionists), it'll be interesting to see</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="The Truth About Casting 'Pretty Little Liars'" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth About Casting 'Pretty Little Liars'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrGwsdJmq6GdXaS0bq%2FArKtmrJieu6x5zp9kraCVYr2zsdOtsGakmanBrbGMpaCaqqNiv6auzqiraA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-beatles-cant-buy-me-love-lyrics.html><span>←</span><span>The Beatles Cant Buy Me Love Lyrics</span></a>
