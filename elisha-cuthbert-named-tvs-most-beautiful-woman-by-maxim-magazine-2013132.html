<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Elisha Cuthbert Named TV's Most Beautiful Woman by Maxim Magazine</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Boob tube beauty! <strong>Elisha Cuthbert</strong> has been named TV's most beautiful woman by the editors of <a href=#>Maxim</a>. Wearing a retro swimsuit on the magazine's March cover, the Happy Endings star calls the honor "very flattering."</p><p>"To think that one person could be the most beautiful when there's <strong>Kaley Cuoco</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Sofia Vergara</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Zooey Deschanel</strong></a>? They're all stunning," says Cuthbert, who has appeared on Maxim's cover three times before. "I'm not gonna fight anyone about it, though. I'll accept it with grace. But being on a show with two other beautiful women [<strong>Casey Wilson</strong> and <strong>Eliza</strong> <strong>Coupe</strong>], this is gonna make going to work very uncomfortable. I don't know, this might be a curse."</p><p>In addition to her TV roles on Happy Endings and 24, Cuthbert is perhaps best known for playing a porn star in the 2004 movie The Girl Next Door.</p><p>"To be honest, I think one reason guys liked that character so much is because I didn't go fully nude. My character really could be the girl of every guy's dreams, instead of having them see her naked and going, 'Oh, that's not my thing,'" Cuthbert, 30, says. "Remember Weird Science? <strong>Kelly LeBrock</strong> never got naked. She didn't show you every­thing. I think that's why it resonated with more men than it probably should have."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>One of the comedy's scenes was filmed at an actual porn convention, Cuthbert recalls. "I remember I had a lot of real porn stars tell me I was like their <a href=#><strong>Julia Roberts</strong></a> from Pretty Woman," she tells <a href=#>Maxim</a>. "Nice sentiment but, you know, a little awkward."</p><p>Cuthbert, who <a href=#>got engaged</a> to Toronto Maple Leafs hockey player <strong>Dion Phaneuf</strong> since September 2012, adds that she's never been the kind of girl who fawns over celebrities. "I haven't had [a crush] since <strong>Jordan</strong> <strong>Knight</strong> from New Kids on the Block, when I was 12. Now I just say <a href=#><strong>Oprah</strong></a>. I love that woman. She'll go to someone's house and bring a huge bucket of oranges she picked from her Santa Barbara home. Oprah, when did you have time to pick two dozen oranges from your garden?"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJyloaOdrm6v1K2fm52iqXqvrcyem2aspqh6rrvSrWSbnZGqwaqy1KVksKedlrturthmpJqwmaJ6rq3GmrGippVif3F9kmpqa2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./texas-woman-seriously-injured-after-hawk-drops-snake-on-her.html><span>←</span><span>Texas Woman Seriously Injured After Hawk Drops Snake On Her</span></a>
