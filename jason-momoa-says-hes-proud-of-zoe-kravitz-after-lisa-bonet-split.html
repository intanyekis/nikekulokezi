Catwoman in the action film —<a href=#> shared the same movie poster</a> on her Instagram on Wednesday, publicizing the release date.</p><p>Momoa commented on the post, writing, “❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥.”</p><p>The snap also featured <a href=#><strong>Robert Pattinson</strong></a> as both Batman and Bruce Wayne, <a href=#><strong>Paul Dano</strong></a> as Edward Nashton a.k.a. The Riddler and <a href=#><strong>Colin Farrell</strong></a> as Oswald Cobblepot a.k.a. The Penguin. “Unmask the truth,” the tagline read.</p><p>The <a href=#>Aquaman</a> star’s <a href=#>praise of Kravitz</a> came a few weeks after he and Bonet, 53, announced on January 12 that <a href=#>they had separated after four years of marriage</a>.</p><p>“We share our Family news ~ That we are parting ways in marriage,” the former couple wrote in a joint statement shared on Momoa’s Instagram page at the time. “We share this not because we think it’s newsworthy ~ But so that ~ as we go about our lives we may do so with dignity and honesty.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Hawaii native</a> and the <a href=#>Cosby Show</a> alum share two children, daughter Lola, 14, and son Nakoa-Wolf, 13. Bonet is also the mother of Zoë, whom she shares with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Lenny Kravitz</strong></a>. (The A Different World alum and <a href=#>the “American Woman” crooner</a>, 57, were married from 1987 to 1993.)</p><p>“The love between us carries on, evolving in ways it wishes to be known and lived,” Momoa and Bonet’s statement concluded. “We free each other ~ to be who we are learning to become … Our devotion unwavering to this sacred life & our children teaching our children what’s possible ~ Living the Prayer — <a href=#>May Love Prevail J & L</a>.”</p><p>The pair <a href=#>began dating in 2005</a> after meeting through mutual friends. They welcomed their kids in July 2007 and December 2008, respectively, before secretly tying the knot in October 2017.</p><p>After nearly two decades together, however, the duo’s differences began taking a toll on their relationship, <a href=#>a source exclusively told Us Weekly</a> earlier this month.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“That energy really started to cause friction because they wanted to live different lives,” the insider said, noting that the High Fidelity actress and <a href=#>the Dune star</a> initially “worked” because of their differing personalities.</p><p>In the end, “Jason wanted to travel and adventure much more. Lisa, she would rather read, write poetry and cook at home,” the source added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmaOku265zqammmWjlsa0eceeqmaooqTCpXnOn2Szp5ViuLOt1aKrs2WRm8GmvoyloKyZXZe8r7HTZqqppJmpfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./holly-hunter-wiki.html><span>←</span><span>Holly Hunter Wiki, Age, Biography, Education, Husband, Family, Career, Net Worth &amp;amp; More</span></a>
