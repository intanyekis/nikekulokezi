The Young Money star’s supposed ex-girlfriend Ericka Lee is stepping into the spotlight and suing him for the use of her voice on the drunken phone call heartbreak anthem “Marvin’s Room.” Lee, who claims to be the female on the other end of the receiver in the song, says Drake excluded her from co-writer royalties.

Lee filed the lawsuit Thursday stating that the two had a romantic and business relationship between early 2010 and mid-2011."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

By November, Lee hired lawyer Neville Johnson, who previously filed a lawsuit against Drake on behalf of Playboy Enterprises for an unauthorized sample the rapper had allegedly used for “Best I Ever Had.”</p><p>The complaint states that Lee’s decision caused Drake to make threatening phone calls, saying “What the f–k is your problem?” He then offered her “4-5%” of publishing compensation plus $50,000 to go away.</p><p>This time, Drake might have to be the one to do better. –Adelle Platon</p><p><strong>UPDATE: Drake’s camp has released a statement refuting these claims.</strong></p><p><span>“This claim is entirely without merit and our client has not engaged in any wrongful conduct. Ericka Lee consented to the use of her voice in the song “Marvin’s Room” prior to its release. Lee asked only for the credit she received as “Syren Lyric Muse,” and she did not ask for any compensation. It was only after she retained a lawyer that there was a demand for payment. &nbsp;Drake tried for months to resolve the matter amicably, and he now looks forward to being vindicated in court.”</span></p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6q9pa3TnptmnKKWuKZ50q6cnWWfq7Kzecyaqa%2Bhnqh6s7vOpmSesF2ctrO4xaugnqaUYoR2hJhuZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-mullin-bio-wiki-age-height-parents-wife-indiana-pacers-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Mullin Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Parents, Wife, Indiana Pacers, and Net Worth</span></a>
