Whether it's <a href=#>Barbie Ferreira's departure</a>, how Angus Cloud <a href=#>approaches his character work</a>, or something in between, people can't get enough of Euphoria's biggest stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong><a href=#>Zendaya</a></strong> is the show's biggest name, and people have noticed that she has great chemistry on screen with Hunter Schafer. Are the two close away from set, or are they just that good at their jobs? Let's take a closer look at how the show brought them together, and if they are as close as they seem.</p><h2 id=euphoria-is-a-smash-hit-show-that-brought-zendaya-and-hunter-schafer-together>Euphoria Is A Smash Hit Show That Brought Zendaya And Hunter Schafer Together</h2><p>Unless you haven't paid attention to major TV the last few years, then you're likely aware that Euphoria is an immensely popular show, that is bolstered by an exceptional young cast.</p><p>The show features major names like Zendaya, Sydney Sweeney, Hunter Schafer, and a lot more.</p><p>One major boost that the show has gotten, is that the actors understand their characters so well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"There's a lot of me in Jules. I do think blurred lines between an actor and a character make a deeper character. The work of an actor is trying to simulate a full life. Some people might say that doesn’t make me as strong of an actor, but … that’s how I learned. I’m still forming that process and also setting boundaries, which I didn’t have in season one," said Schafer.</p><p>Early on, it was quite clear that many of the stars of the series had bonded behind the scenes, and given their chemistry in front of the cameras, people were curious to know how things are between Zendaya and Hunter Schafer. Turns out, the pair are extremely close when the cameras aren't rolling.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Some Fans Felt Let Down By Season Two Of Euphoria; Will Season Three Be Better?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-two-are-as-thick-as-thieves-outside-the-show>The Two Are As Thick As Thieves Outside The Show</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar51182017.jpg><p>Zendaya and Hunter Schafer are incredible friends, and early on Zendaya could see that she needed to look out for the young Schafer.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Said Zendaya</a>, "Knowing that [Hunter] was so young and so much of this was new to her … My thing was being as much of a big sister as I could. What we do for a living is important, but the friendship we share is more important.”</p><p>This was hugely helpful to Schafer, who was learning on the fly.</p><p>"Season one was like a super intense acting course. Even in the pilot, I remember in between takes being like, ‘Oh my God, this is so f--king hard. I have no idea what I'm doing," the actress said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She went on to say, "I was really truly learning while making an HBO television show, which is just a wild circumstance to be in… I think I'm finally at a place where I'm like, okay I like this, I can keep doing this."</p><p>Having Zendaya must have been a breath of fresh air, and the duo became close friends, thanks to spending so much time filming together.</p><p>Just like any set of friends, the pair even have a nickname for one another, according to Schafer.</p><p>"We call each other 'boob' or 'boobies. It's endearing, you know," she said.</p><p>For the experienced Zendaya, this is hardly the only co-star that she has become close friends with.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Which Cast Members Are Returning For Euphoria's Much Anticipated Third Season?</a></span></p><h2 id=zendaya-has-gotten-close-with-numerous-castmates>Zendaya Has Gotten Close With Numerous Castmates</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar52263094.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Zendaya and Zac Efron starred as love interests in The Greatest Showman, but in real life they're great friends. Efron even gushed to Vogue about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how impressive Zendaya was in doing her own stunts for the movie.</a></p><p>"While I was wincing in pain and covering myself in Tiger Balm and KT tape, Zendaya would move to her next scene completely unfazed," Efron said. He shared a photo of the pair while promoting The Greatest Showman, dubbing them "Z squared,'" Ranker wrote.</p><p>Zendaya has also had public friendships with co-stars like Timothee Chalamet, Jacob Batalon, and plenty more.</p><p>Zendaya has also found love with one of her co-stars.</p><p>In keeping with the Spider-Man actor falls for his leading lady, MCU's Tom Holland has been with Zendaya for years now.</p><p>The two kept things under wraps for quite some time, but eventually, their relationship came to light.
