When Sandoval tries to tell her that he and the former pageant queen <a href=#>became “really good friends”</a> before starting their romance, the Florida native explodes with anger. “I don’t give a f–k about f–king Raquel!” Ariana yells. “Your friendship is f–king bulls–t.”</p><p>The video doesn’t offer any hints about <a href=#>where Sandoval and Raquel stand now</a>, but in one scene, they cuddle up together as Raquel laments, “It turned out so horribly wrong.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Vanderpump-Rules-Season-10-Finale-Trailer-Teases-Major-Confrontation-Between-Ariana-Madix-and-Tom-Sandoval-055.jpg><p>At the end of the clip, <a href=#><strong>Kristen Doute</strong></a> makes her highly anticipated return, saying, “You ready?” before waggling her fingers mischievously. The Michigan native, 40, was fired from Pump Rules in 2020, but <a href=#>she returned to film an episode</a> for season 10 in the aftermath of Scandoval. <a href=#>Kristen previously dated Sandoval</a> from 2007 to 2013. As Pump Rules viewers recall, they split after Kristen found out that <a href=#>Sandoval and Ariana kissed</a> during a trip to Las Vegas.</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed in March that the former SUR bartender and Ariana called it quits after Ariana discovered Sandoval’s affair with Leviss, which <a href=#>began in August 2022</a>. Much of season 10 was filmed before the infidelity came to light, but after the news broke, <a href=#>the cast picked cameras back up</a> to capture the aftermath of the scandal. The reunion then taped on March 23.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong><a href=#>Lisa Vanderpump</a></strong> recently claimed that the reunion is <a href=#>going to be “very long,”</a> though she didn’t reveal how many parts may air. “I mean, normally, the maximum they do is three [parts],” the restaurateur, 62, told Extra on Saturday, April 29. “I think they could do three, four weeks of it [because] there’s so much stuff that goes down.”</p><p>Vanderpump Rules airs on Bravo Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET. The season finale is set to air on Wednesday, May 17.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKeupaBiv7a4xKxkrJ2RqLyvecWipZqklWLBs63IpZyrZaSarrSx0maYq6GRo65uv8Cnm6iukaF6p7XGoato</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./your-honor-season-2-cast.html><span>←</span><span>Your Honor Season 2 Cast, Real Name, Actors StarsUnfolded</span></a>
