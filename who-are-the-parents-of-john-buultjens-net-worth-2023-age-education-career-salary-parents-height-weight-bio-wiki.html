He is a part of multiple professions.&nbsp;<strong>John Buultjens</strong>&nbsp;is a BMX figure and competitor, author, actor, and manager. After knowing about his life as a survivor, there seems to be nothing he cannot do.</h3><h2 class=wp-block-image>How much is the Net worth of John Buultjens?</h2><h2>Early Years: Where was John Buultjens born?</h2><p>On March 16, 1971, John Buultjens was born in Glasgow, Scotland. His father’s identity is unknown to the general public, and his mother is Margaret Craig. John will be 51 years old in 2022. Rory McCord, his older brother, and his two sisters were all around when John was growing up.</p><p>Domestic abuse and violence were a part of John’s upbringing with his birth family. When he was only three years old, he eagerly ran to meet his father but was instead dropped into an electric fire. He remarks that he can still vividly recall the scorching sensation at that time.</p><p>Although though John had to struggle to survive as a youngster, abuse and traumatic experiences still happened to him, even around the holidays. When John was seven years old, he witnessed his father beating his mother and used a knife to protect her. Though he was prepared to execute his father, he was knocked unconscious.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/young-John-Buultjens-roller-skating.jpg><p>Following this, John’s mother placed him in a Scottish foster care system, where he was later adopted by a different family. His times began to change at this point.</p><h2>What is the Professional Career of John Buultjens?</h2><p>From 1984 until 1988, John Buultjens attended Harris Academy in Dundee, Scotland. He has held positions as a chef, BMX competitor, actor, author, CEO, and global manager, among others. John needed about six months to adjust after being adopted by the Buultjens Family. Then, at the age of 10, Eldridge, his foster father, took him to the movies.</p><p>E.T. The Extraterrestrial, directed by Steven Speilberg, was the movie. He felt something inside of him flare up when he saw the bikes soaring; as he watched, he realized how much freedom he was longing for. John was given a BMX bike by Eldridge. On it, John would design his stunts. He thought that through riding, he might get away from his terrible history.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/John-Buultjens-Haro-Bikes.jpg><p>He gradually started to compete locally on the BMX Circuit. Although being aware of the dangers on the field, he kept pushing himself. John later relocated to Australia in his 20s. He focused more on tournaments there.</p><p>So he started his own company and rose to the position of CEO. He started designing bikes as his business increased his reputation as a bike rider and designer.&nbsp;Haro Bikes contacted him after learning of his remarkable accomplishment and offered him a position as the company’s worldwide brand manager.</p><h3 id=maybe-this-was-destiny>Maybe This Was Destiny?</h3><p>The Extraterrestrial, the movie that served as John’s inspiration, featured a notable stunt rider named Bob Haro, the inventor of Haro Bikes. John agreed to the offer and moved to California. Ali Afshar, a Hollywood producer, contacted John in California. Ali was interested in buying one of his bikes.</p><p>The following year, Ali contacted John to make an offer to buy one of his bicycles. One day, the two discussed their passion of bikes over lunch. Afshar first learned about John’s past narrative at that point. His tale captured Afshar’s interest, and with John’s approval, he turned it into a movie. The Ride, a movie, was released after eighteen months.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/The-3-John-Buultjens-from-the-movie-Ride..jpg><p>John also published a book on his life in which he talked about his drug use, partying, and potential for having a second daughter.</p><h2>Who are the Parents of John Buultjens?</h2><p>Margaret Craig and his father, whose real name is unknown, were the parents of John Buultjens.&nbsp;Growing up in a home that engaged in domestic violence, his early years were all about survival. Margaret died, and shortly after she had placed him and his siblings in foster care, his father also passed away.</p><p>When John was ten years old, Marianna Buultjens and Eldrige Buultjens adopted him.&nbsp; His foster father is a Sri Lankan immigrant, and his foster mother Marianna is a native Scot. At a gathering in Glasgow, Scotland, Marianna and Eldridge first spoke. Their wedding day was December 22, 1974.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/John-Buultjens-foster-Parents.jpg><p>John struggled to fit in with this family, particularly Eldridge. He was ashamed of Eldridge because of his appearance, and it was due of the hue of his skin.&nbsp;Nonetheless, he now admits that his birth family practiced racial supremacy and he was illiterate back then. He adds that he is embarrassed by how he felt at the time.</p><p>Yet notice how he thinks differently and how effectively his parents have prepared him. John also mentioned how Eldridge did so much for him and taught him what love really meant.</p><h2>What is the Relationship Status of John Buultjens?</h2><p>John was in a relationship when he moved to Australia in his 20s (for the full story, scroll down under Careers). He wed the woman in 2005. The name of his wife is unknown as of this writing. A daughter was born to the couple. But regrettably, things didn’t work out, and in 2011, when their daughter was just four years old, his wife filed for divorce.</p><p>The final time John saw his daughter was when their ex-wife was granted custody of her. His entire life was dedicated to hard effort and success at the expense of his loved ones. According to his social media posts and accounts, John Buultjens appears to be dating a female.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/John-Buultjens-at-Glassgows-Book-Festival.jpg><p>He routinely posts her images on social media with a statement praising her presence in his life. John recently revealed that a female night nurse had also assaulted him and other boys while they were children. He said that when he was 12 years old, an older girl named “Evon” (Yvonne) sexually assaulted him as well. He also claimed that he may have another unknowing second child.</p><p>A daughter is the product of Johannes Buultjens’ marriage. Mackenzie Mae is the name of his daughter, and she goes by Mack.

His father beat him and even tossed him into an electric fire as part of an abusive household.</p><p>He often faced life-threatening risks while competing in BMX, but it didn’t stop him from having a passion for riding.
