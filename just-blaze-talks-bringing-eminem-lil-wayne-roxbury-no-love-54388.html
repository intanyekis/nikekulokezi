We did his part together. He’s real laid back and just kind of on his own plane.” Just adds. “He went into the vocal booth for like an hour or two and had his rhyme.”</span></p><p><span>It took Marshall a small reminder to realize where the song’s flamboyant sample originated from. But with Just Blaze’s push Em wasted no time in turning the record into a smash.</span></p><p><span>“I gave him the framework of what the record could be about and a couple vocal ideas that I had for the hook. He knocked it out like two days later,” Just said, adding that the final touch came when he stepped from behind the board and into the booth. “After it was completed, I went back and added me singing the ‘No Love’ part.”</span></p><p><span>In other <a href=# id=auto-tag_news_3 data-tag=news>news</a>, last night Just Blaze opened the doors to his newly renovated and expanded recording studio at StadiumRed in Harlem.&nbsp;—</span><span>Mikey Fresh</span></p><p><span><strong><span><span>SEE ALSO:</span></span></strong></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2FCtMCMm6OaspViwaK4yqxkm6qZo7SqusZmnKahnpq6brjIpWSwmamjsm6%2BzrGZrqqpYruwecuorZ5lZWmAeYSO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katia-langenheim.html><span>←</span><span>All About Katia Langenheim - Learn of The Mother Of Ruby Rose, Bio, Divorce, Husband, and Net Worth</span></a>
