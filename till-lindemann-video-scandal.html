A concertgoer testified that Lindemann had promised her sex in exchange for backstage access. Moreover, he says.</p><p>That “everything happened quickly and violently.”</p><p>While some women may have anticipated a sexual encounter, others were caught off guard by the prospect.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The singer’s aggressive demeanor took them aback. “It’s still a 60-year-old world star, multi-millionaire who speaks to young girls aged 21 to 22 who adore him,” stresses Daniel Drepper to emphasize the singer’s responsibilities.</p><p>22-year-old Cynthia A. (pseudonym), during a concert in 2020, recalled that Till Lindemann had waved her over to join him backstage. That he “showed something” was what he wanted to hear.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>She claims she got forced into sexual intercourse in a connecting room. Her testimony includes, “I thought then, ‘Oh my God, this hurts, let’s hope it’s over soon. Things escalated rapidly and aggressively.&nbsp;</p><p>According to another source, Lindemann got asked if he could “continue” by the singer after she passed out in his hotel room. She gives her testimony, “I didn’t even know what he wanted to talk about.”</p><p>The investigation team was careful and thorough in their work. To demonstrate his good faith in the court, he secured statements from all these young women under the seal of anonymity and oath.&nbsp;</p><p>Before giving their testimony, he made sure the witnesses were strangers to one another. It’s complaints against Lindemann as of yet.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the benefits, women are still hesitant to take the plunge, as noted by Daniel Drepper.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Famous and Scandels is Rammstein Band?</h2><p>The scandal hits Rammstein hard just before they head out on a tour of Europe.&nbsp;</p><p>Tickets for his upcoming four shows at Munich’s Olympic Stadium this month sold out in a matter of days, with over 240,000 fans in attendance.&nbsp;</p><p>On July 22, the band will take the stage at the Stade de France. The Suddeutsche Zeitung once wrote, “Rammstein is Germany’s top cultural export product.”</p><p>Provocation is essential to Rammstein’s success. This band, formed in 1994 by East German musicians, has a sulfurous moniker alone.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=de dir=ltr>🙃So funktioniert Karma – der Rammstein-Solist fiel von der Bühne, nachdem er auf Russisch gesprochen hatte</p><p>Der Frontmann der Rockband Till Lindemann geriet bei einem Konzert in Vilnius (Litauen) in Verlegenheit .
