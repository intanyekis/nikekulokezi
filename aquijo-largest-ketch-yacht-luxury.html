Billionaire Norweigan businessman, Kjell Inge Røkke, is currently the yacht owner. He observes that this vessel was not built to boast of <a href=#>its enormous size, but its speed</a>.&nbsp;Kjell Inge Røkke loves to sail and go on cruises in his beautiful vessel.&nbsp;<a href=#>This fast sailing yacht is gigantic</a> because the owner wanted to enjoy as much interior space as possible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, he says that his main wish is to sail in the Ketch across South America. Sailing during long cruises, he also wants to have the most pleasant time with his family. This is why the Aquijo was built to be the largest sailing ketch to make the buyer feel at home.</p><p>Here's why this massive yacht is called a luxury home on water.</p><h2 id=its-exquisite-design>Its Exquisite Design</h2><p>Like a lot of other superyachts, the Aquijo too boasts exquisite interiors. It has a pedigree design which Oceano built in collaboration with Vitters. Bill Tripp developed the naval architectural plans of the vessel's exterior body.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Meet NORD Superyacht: The Tuxedo'd Warship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The owner of Aquijo wanted <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the interiors to be 'homey.'</a> His wife made most of the choices regarding <a href=#>interior designing</a>; the fashionable interiors were stylized by Dolker in collaboration with Voges.</p><h2 id=the-brilliant-built>The Brilliant Built</h2><p>The Aquijo is about 86 meters or 282 feet long and reached its completion in construction in 2016. The beam has a length of 14.48 meters or 47.5 feet, and the draught about 5.23 meters or 17.2 feet. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This superyacht</a> has a vast sail area of almost 3995 square meters. The sails expand over approximately 64,500 square feet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Aquijo functions over complex hydraulics to become a fast-moving ketch that bears so much weight. An expert crew has been employed who are very well versed with how to sail this beast smoothly. The superyacht has been registered under Llyod's foundation. The Aquijo was reported to be out on a cruise last summer with an average pace of 19 knots and sometimes hitting a maximum of 30 knots.</p><p>The sailor of this ship says that the owner wanted to put together all the good parts of various superyachts and <a href=#>create this masterpiece</a>. But this large ketch is not only fancily designed, but also highly sturdy. The hull is made of steel and the vessel's superstructure is made of aluminum, while the decks are teak laid.</p><h2 id=the-amenities-of-a-house>The Amenities Of A House</h2><p>The Aquijo might come with brilliant hydraulics and extraordinary design but what defines its luxury is the host of amenities available on this yacht. It is spacious enough to accommodate about 12 guests in seven cabin rooms and a dining space that can hold up to 24 guests. The interior designs of the master bedrooms and the cabins are elegant yet light and breezy. The crew capacity is about 17.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The most attractive feature of this luxury home on water is a private deck, which also comes with a rear-facing bedroom that can offer a 270 degrees view of the ocean. Aquijo's owner seems incredibly excited to wake up here every morning and enjoy the marvelous view. The guest cabins are equally grand; they too come with beautiful views of the ocean.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Aquijo</a> has beautiful beach clubs with a sauna and steam rooms, various bars, and everything else that a billionaire would want on their yacht. The three bars are all extravagant, including one on the power's deck, another on the big main deck, and the last near the <a href=#>fancy jacuzzi built especially on demand</a>.</p><p>The jacuzzi is placed right below the central deck skylight, offering a cozy environment, especially in winters. This particular design was a wish of the owner, and he says that it is one of his favorite spots on the yacht. Besides the main elevator, there is also a guest elevator and a roof over, and the dining space in the main deck is retractable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even the engine room on the yacht occupies a generous amount of space. Nowhere on this yacht is there a congested atmosphere. The areas occupied by the machinery and technicalities have been masterfully distributed all over the ship, starting from the center to its complete length.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Aquijo</a> has proven to exceed Røkke's expectations and is grabbing a lot of attention from the media and the public. The massive yacht can be availed on rent with a charge of about $536,541.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>USS Gerald R.
