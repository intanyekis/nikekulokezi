Lucas or Nathan?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>Hearties are anxiously waiting for the Season 10 finale of When Calls the Heart. As Erin and Lucas’ relationship faces uncertainty, the burning question lingers:</span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href=#>Who does Elizabeth end up with on When Calls the Heart</a>? Here’s everything we know ahead of Season 10’s anticipated ending.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>When Calls the Heart</a>&nbsp;is Hallmark’s drama series following the residents of Hope Valley (previously known as Coal Valley), a small town in Western Canada where life is simple but still fraught with challenges. The series, which was based on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Janette Oke’s book</a>&nbsp;of the same name and started as a Hallmark original movie in October 2013, centers around Elizabeth Thatcher, a young teacher accustomed to high-society life who moves to Hope Valley after she receives her first classroom assignment there.</p><p>Doubts about Elizabeth and Lucas’s relationship emerged in Season 10, Episode 11, when Lucas mentioned his potential run for Governor. He emphasized that if he pursued and won the election, he’d have to relocate to Capitol City. Upon hearing this, Elizabeth confided in Nathan, who prompted her to consider her deep affection for Hope Valley. “Just yesterday, you expressed your desire never to leave Hope Valley,” Nathan reminded her, hoping she would remain true to her heart.</p><p>The dramatic storyline comes as Elizabeth and Lucas have been noticeably growing apart. Wedding preparations have taken a back seat, with fewer shared scenes between Elizabeth and Lucas in recent episodes. Instead, Elizabeth’s interactions are mainly centered around Nathan. Notably, she declined Lucas’ proposal to construct a new house for her, hinting that there’s something else weighing on her mind.</p><h2>Who does Elizabeth end up with on When Calls the Heart?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Erin-Krakow-and-Chris-McNally-WCTH.png alt="Erin Krakow and Chris McNally, WCTH" width=1024 height=599 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Who does Elizabeth end up with on When Calls the Heart? We’re not sure, but we’re leaning toward Nathan. In last week’s episode, Elizabeth revealed that she will not be joining her finance on his gubernatorial campaign trail. “This is where I want to raise my son,” she told him in the emotional scene. “This is where I want to be.”</p><p>Although he offered to stay with her, she would not allow that. “If you don’t get on that train, we both know you’ll regret it,” she insisted. “You’re bound for a bigger stage, and I think you know that in your heart.”&nbsp;While Elizabeth wished that she could “give him all of her heart,” she acknowledged that she couldn’t, and they parted ways before the Season 10 finale, which will reveal the results of the election.</p><p>In Season 8, Nathan openly expressed his love for Elizabeth, but her heart led her to choose Lucas over him. The couple got engaged in Season 9 and started planning their wedding in Season 10. Yet, in recent episodes, their bond has shown signs of weakening. The first hints of Elizabeth’s possible romantic feelings for Nathan surfaced when he was held hostage in Season 10, Episode 9.</p><p data-skm-boomerang-el-31=processed><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/When-Calls-the-Heart-Elizabeth-Nathan.jpg alt="When Calls the Heart - Elizabeth, Nathan" width=1024 height=599 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>“I can’t do this again,” she told Gowen. “Not again.” Elizabeth’s first husband, Jack Thornton, was killed by a landslide while on a training mission in Fort Clay. “I think perhaps you should give some thought to how you were feeling yesterday,” Gowen asks her later in the episode. When Elizabeth tells him she’s fine and she is just worried about a friend, he responds: “You’re certain?”</p><p id=par-18_10 data-skm-boomerang-el-31=processed>“I’m fine, Henry. You’re mistaken,” she stated before walking away.</p><p>The ending of their engagement aligns with speculations about <a href=#>McNally’s departure</a>, as the show hints at his character relocating to Capitol City. This move also sets the stage for a compelling love triangle involving Lucas, Elizabeth, and Nathan. If Lucas wins the election and departs, it provides a fitting exit for McNally’s character and neatly ties up his storyline with Hope Valley in the Season 10 finale.</p><p data-skm-boomerang-el-31=processed>After watching the preview for the Season 10 finale, it’s becoming more and more likely that either Elizabeth and Nathan will admit that they have feelings for one another. In the teaser, Elizabeth confides in Rosemary, suggesting that Nathan’s absence may be an attempt to avoid her. As they eventually come face to face, the tension is palpable, with Nathan looking like he has something very important to tell her.</p><p data-skm-boomerang-el-31=processed>Watch the&nbsp;<a href=#>preview for tonight’s episode</a>, below.</p><p></p><p data-skm-boomerang-el-31=processed>Tune into the When Calls the Heart&nbsp;Season 10 finale on Sunday, October 15, at 9 p.m. on Hallmark Channel.</p><p><strong>For more on&nbsp;When Calls the Heart, check out our&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>gallery on who the cast is dating and married to in real life</a>&nbsp;below.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhuaWp9d4SOsJ%2BoZZWhtrutwZ6roWWVo7Fuwc9mrqKsmGLEqbHNZpqapJyoerW0xGafnpmiqXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-doobie-brotherssanother-park-another-sunday-lyrics.html><span>←</span><span>The Doobie BrotherssAnother Park, Another Sunday Lyrics</span></a>
