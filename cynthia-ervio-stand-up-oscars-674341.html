Although&nbsp;Erivo didn’t take home an award, she did earn a standing ovation for her performance that was filled with emotion and heartfelt falsettos. During her performance, Erivo is surrounded by singers complementing her gorgeous gold gown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-10-at-8.52.40-AM-1581342775.png><p>At the end of her performance, the audience sees an iconic black and white photo of Tubman, who Erivo portrayed in the Kasi Lemmons biopic. While fans seemed to be enthralled by her performance, the Oscar for Best Original Song went to “(I’m Gonna) Love Me Again) by&nbsp;Elton John and&nbsp;Bernie Taupin.</p><p>Speaking with VIBE at Clive Davis’ Pre-Grammy Gala, the actress pointed out the need for more representation and diversity in Hollywood. The Academy played true to the growing #OscarsSoWhite movement as Ervio was the only black actor to receive a nomination in the acting categories.</p><p>“To not be the only one means to have everyone celebrated,” she said. “We need to learn that people should be celebrated when they’re here; there’s so much good work going on and beautiful work being made that if we don’t pay attention to it, it will pass us by and we will suffer a great loss from it.”</p><p>In addition to dropping major gems and divine high notes, Erivo also slayed on the Oscars red carpet, as well as the carpet for Vanity Fair’s Oscars celebration.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1205162590-1581342634.jpg><p>“Cynthia’s look was simple fairytale glam,” celebrity hairstylist Coree Moreno shared with VIBE. Moreno teamed up with Dove to use their upcoming Dove Amplified Textured hair products for Erivo’s perfect crop. “I was inspired by the custom Versace gown and the way it sparkles and wanted to recreate a hair moment to compliment the gown.”</p><p>“We started the morning with a double process color leaving her hair pearly white.
