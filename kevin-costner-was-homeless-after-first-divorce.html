However, that did not look like a case that helped Baumgartner during the divorce suit because Costner denied ever having an affair while married to her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Seeing how Costner did not relent on giving up everything not in the contract and only offered little more in compensation for the kids and not his wife, those who understood knew where Baumgartner was coming from.</p><p>Unsurprisingly for the actor, he was not made aware of the divorce and felt blindsided, which felt like he was being vindictive about the divorce settlement and did not want to give in to his ex-wife.</p><p>On the other hand, it seemed reasonable that Costner would be adamant about settling since the actor had been through a pricey divorce before.</p><p>When he divorced his first wife in 1994, <a href=#>Kevin Costner paid up to $80 million in a settlement after 16 years of marriage to Cindy Silva</a>.</p><p>The pricey divorce made headlines and was a lesson learned for many. <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Keven Costner also revealed his first divorce left him homeless</a></strong> (explaining why he was unwilling to give up the house), which was why he wanted an ironclad prenup for his second marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After this expensive divorce from his first wife, it was natural that Costner would not make the same mistake again. Some comments pointed out that he did pay more than stipulated in the prenup, but towards the care of his children (school, health insurance, vacation, etc.) outside the monthly child support payment. However, that did not mean the same for his ex-wife.</p><p>That’s why others believed Baumgartner was being greedy with her demands. Some fans noted that the three children the former couple shared should be the most important, at all times.</p><p>With the back-and-forth in the discussion sub-thread, nobody in the group could ultimately say the couple got what they wanted. However, the best outcome did mean Costner got to keep most of his $250 million net worth.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/kevin-costner-s-ex-fumbled-the-bag-in-their-divorce-settlement.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Kevin Costner's Ex Fumbled The Bag In Their Divorce Settlement">Kevin Costner's Ex Fumbled The Bag In Their Divorce Settlement</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Christine Baumgartner ended up with much less than she anticipated following her divorce from Kevin Costner.</p><h2 id=kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-are-moving-on-after-the-rough-divorce>Kevin Costner And Christine Baumgartner Are Moving On After The Rough Divorce</h2><h3 id=kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-are-in-new-relationships-after-their-divorce-settlement>Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner are in new relationships after their divorce settlement</h3><p>After the whole argument and contesting the premarital agreement before settling on a slightly different arrangement from the prenup, former couple Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner are moving on with their lives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/christine-baumgartner-kevin-costner.jpg><p><a href=#>Kevin Costner revealed he was dating musician Jewel</a> in late 2023.
