Both of them had&nbsp;a white beaded necklace around their necks.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>That being said, it was undoubtedly the rock on Crawley's ring finger that called for the most attention. Evidently, the couple was enjoying their time in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hawaii</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Broke up Five Months After Engagement</h2><p>The couple first got together on the sixteenth season of The Bachelorette and put a ring on their relationship by the end of the season. Five months later, by January 2021, the couple had called it quits and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">parted ways</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The couple had announced their breakup via an Instagram post on Moss's handle&nbsp;but has since been removed. At the time, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wrote</a>,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>We appreciate the love and support we've received from so many people, but this is the healthiest decision for both of us at this time.</p><p>He further explained that both of them strongly believed in leading with love and remaining true to themselves, as both their families instilled those values in them.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>He concluded by saying that they only hoped for the best for one another. While the 39-year-old posted all this, Crawley's socials were mum.</p><h2>They Split Amid Infidelity&nbsp;Rumors</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ET</a>, many believed that their breakup was a consequence of infidelity. Moss addressed those rumors during his time on the Hollywood Raw Podcast with Dax Holt and Adam Glyn.</p><p>He explained how the cheating allegations&nbsp;weren't even a part of the conversation when the two went through their breakup. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Instead, the couple looked past that and focused on one another.&nbsp;</p><p>Even so, the reality star <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">agreed</a> that&nbsp;having to deal with the scandal was difficult.&nbsp;</p><p>When things are going at your character, and something you're completely against, those are the hardest things to handle.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Going by how things turned out in the end, the couple definitely worked through their issues and found their way back to dating each other.</p><p>Before the couple made things Instagram official again, they were seen strolling hand in hand through the streets of New York City in early April.&nbsp;</p><p>They were walking past the Flatiron District with Moss holding a cup of&nbsp;coffee in one hand and Crawler's hand in another.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnlJa5pnnMqKqsZZSWwaq6xmaeoqqcm7%2Bqsc2dZaGsnaE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./betsy-woodruff-married-husband-affairs-net-worth-facts-wiki-bio.html><span>←</span><span>Betsy Woodruff Married, Husband, Affairs, Net Worth, Facts, Wiki-Bio</span></a>
