Before she could remove it, the hawk attack began.</p><p>“As I was trying to sling my arm and sling the snake off, the snake wrapped around my arm,” she told CBS News.</p><p>“The snake was striking in my face, it struck my glasses a couple of times… I was slinging and slinging, he was striking and striking, and he just kept hanging on.”</p><p>She realised it must have been dropped by a passing bird, since she was not standing under trees when it happened. Her assumption was quickly confirmed when the hawk swooped down and joined in the melee.</p><p>“Then the hawk appeared just as fast as the snake appeared,” Mrs Jones said.</p><p><strong>Also Read</strong>: <a href=#>US Supreme Court Restores Biden ‘Ghost Gun’ Rules, For Now</a></p><p>“The hawk grabbed the snake that was wrapped around my arm and pulled it like he was going to carry it away.
