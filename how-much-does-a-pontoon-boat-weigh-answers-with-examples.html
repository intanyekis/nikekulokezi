These pontoons (also called tubes) contain much reserve buoyancy and allow designers to create massive deck plans fitted with all sorts of accommodations such as expansive lounge areas, stand-up bars, and sun pads.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Better tube designs have allowed builders to put ever-increasing amounts of horsepower on the stern. The drafts may be as shallow as eight inches, which reduces risk of running aground and underwater damage, this allows it to come close to shore to pick up and drop off loads.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>It was first invented by a farmer called </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span style=font-weight:400>Ambrose Weeres</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> who lived close to Richmond, Minnesota in the United States.
