But it’s a really big misquoted thing. Everybody is saying she hates her fans. Never said that, but I do like to play with that as a meme. I know that people who get it, get it. And I’m fine with that.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">She further explained, “I don’t have to explain <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234772452>my sense of humor </a>and explain comedy to anyone. If people don’t see the joke, then they just don’t see the joke, and it’s not my responsibility to have them understand.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In July, a fan tweeted the “Say So” singer asking her to say that she loves her fans, to which she responded “I don’t though cuz i don’t even know yall.” In the same month Doja also came at fans on Threads for using her government name as their screen name and calling themselves “Kittenz” — a name she’s referred to her fans as in the past.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“If you call yourself a ‘Kitten’ or f**king ‘Kittenz’ that means you need to get off your phone and get a job and help your parents with the house.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Elsewhere in her conversation with Ebro, Doja clarified <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234784598>“dark” images </a>found in her latest music videos like “Paint The Town Red.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Critics claimed that the record-breaking artist was using satanic imagery, referring to a green monster with two horns in the visual.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“That was a painting I painted. My painting isn’t a **king weapon,” she spoke of the creature that she dances on top of <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234777978>in the video.</a> “It isn’t offensive. It’s just a green goblin-y monster guy. … That was a really big piece for me. It was one of my proudest moments ever, and people wrote that off as Satanism, and it’s literally just a little green guy with horns and I’m standing on his head! Where’s the harm?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Declaring that she’s not able to please everyone, she said, “I’m not gonna make everyone happy, and that’s just that. I’m just not, and I know that I’m not, so that’s freed me immensely.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Watch Doja’s full interview above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5m8q62MnJitZaKawLG7zZ2qZqCRqbavs4yfmKerXZeyqrrGZqqarJGjtqR5kGtqbXBjaX5zgI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dimitrious-stanley-biography-fact-career-awards-net-worth-and-life-story.html><span>←</span><span>Dimitrious Stanleys biography, net worth, fact, career, awards and life story</span></a>
