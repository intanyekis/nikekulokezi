He’s reconnected with his friend <strong>Hayden</strong>, who has helped him navigate the City of Angels.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“Looking back, I had almost no experience with anything say pop culture or from the world. Like Superman, Spider-Man, The Hulk, I didn’t really know who any of those were,” Micah admits. Hayden says that Micah is like a “different person” now that he’s learned so much about the real world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/welcome-to-plathville-season-4-preview-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Micah is embracing everything Los Angeles has to offer — even marijuana. “Smoking weed is legal out here, and I’ve experimented with weed several times,” Micah reveals. “I told my mom and, believe it or not, she was like, ‘Oh I don’t really care. My mom used to grow it.'” Micah notes that his mother “definitely used to be a party person” before she got married.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Micah has been taking acting lessons and signed with a modeling agency. He’s even booked some modeling gigs already!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>As for dating, Micah is well aware that the dating pool is much larger in LA. “There’s such a bigger variety of girls out here, Shoot, there’s boys that look like girls out here. You never know what you’re going to get,” Micah says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/welcome-to-plathville-season-4-preview-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>The official synopsis for season 4 reads: “<strong>Kim</strong> and <strong>Barry</strong> raised their nine kids on an idyllic and secluded farm in southern Georgia, separated from social media and modern culture but life looks a whole lot different for the family now. <strong>Ethan</strong>, <strong>Olivia</strong>, and <strong>Moriah</strong> are in Tampa, far from the family drama but making it on their own in a new city is not all fun and games. Micah is stretching his wings in Los Angeles and finding new friends and room to grow. Kim and Barry have five of their nine kids still living in their house but life is no longer as conservative as it once was. Kim is questioning their lifestyle and her choices overall and some unexpected alliances and friendships occur as a result. As the Plaths explore new cities, navigate their love lives, change and grow in ways none of them ever expected, what’s certain is the recent past never seemed so far behind.” Welcome to Plathville airs Tuesdays at 10 p.m. on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e5BwZrCdnJi8rrGMraZmqJyWwanCyKWjnmWjmq60u81ma2aooprDqrHWZqSim5GderW%2ByJ6qZq%2BVmrFuwsidnKhn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kelby-krabbenhoft-net-worth-biography-wiki-salary-wife-married-education-sanford.html><span>←</span><span>Kelby Krabbenhoft Net worth, Biography, Wiki, Salary, Wife, Married, Education, Sanford</span></a>
