It was a good ol’ Jersey fist fight — in Italy.
Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino and Ronnie Ortiz-Magro got into what’s being called a “major fist fight” last night during the show’s filming in Italy. Photos taken afterward show The Situation, who had the hood of a sweatshirt pulled over his head, with red marks on his face and Ronnie with what appeared to be fresh cuts on his knuckles."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Only real Italian pizza,” according to various Italian newspapers. Tamarri is Italian slang that can be roughly translated as yokel or uncultured idiot.</p><p>And officials banned the meatball-loving, booze-swilling cast from shooting at some of the most famous locations in the Renaissance city — including the renowned Uffizi gallery and the sculpture-filled Boboli Gardens.</p><p>Mayor Matteo Renzi also declared the stars must not be filmed in bars and clubs that serve alcohol and must not be filmed drinking in public. He also said he wants the show to promote Italy and feature its culture, traditions and good food.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2JlfnJ7j25ma2xfn7Kzv8SyZKygn6eytHnToZxmq5mpwqLAyKilZqqfo7uqsYygnK1lmaN6p7XSrWSfoZedwW6%2BxKmmq6xf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./atlanta-will-host-2021-nba-all-star-game.html><span>←</span><span>Atlanta Will Host The 2021 NBA All-Star Game On March 7</span></a>
