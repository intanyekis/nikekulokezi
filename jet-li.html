He gave up martial arts at the age of 17 and began his profession. Although he began receiving modest roles at the age of 17, his work at the Shaolin Temple helped him establish a reputation in the Chinese film business. He eventually overtook Jackie Chan as the top star in the Chinese cinema industry at the time.</p><h2>What is the Net Worth of Jet Li?</h2><p>Jet Li, the best Singaporean actor in the world, is worth <strong>$250 million</strong>. The most well-known Singaporean film actor , according to a number of internet publications (Wikipedia, Forbes, IMDB), is believed to have a net worth of about <strong>$250 million</strong>.</p><table class="has-pale-ocean-gradient-background has-background"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Name</strong></td><td><strong>Jet Li</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth (2022)</strong></td><td><strong>$250 Million</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td><strong>Singaporean Film Actor</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Monthly Income And Salary</strong></td><td><strong>$2 Million +</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Yearly Income And Salary</strong></td><td><strong>$20 Million +</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Last Updated</strong></td><td><strong>2022</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Jet Li’s lifestyle hasn’t really changed despite his <strong>$250 million</strong> increase in wealth; perhaps this is because he never lost sight of his humble beginnings as a member of a very low-income family. You are aware that he traveled from Beijing to Hong Kong, then from <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>Hong Kong</strong></a> to Los Angeles before returning to Singapore from <strong><a href=# rel=nofollow>Los Angeles</a></strong>. In each of these four locations, he has a home.</p><p>He isn’t known for being extravagant. He is said to devote roughly 20% of his income to charitable endeavors. His reputation for goodwill can be determined by the fact that the Red Cross named him as its international goodwill ambassador sometime in 2010.

He’s a well-known actor from Hollywood. When given the chance to appear in Lethal Weapon 4, <strong><a href=#>Jackie Chan</a></strong> received his first starring role in a Hollywood production. Following this, he moved from Beijing to Los Angeles and continued to work in Chinese films.</p><p>He is always working on movies in both Chinese and English.

You can both go to two Chinese restaurants, but both can have different kinds of food.”&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp;Jet Li</strong></li><li>”&nbsp;Everywhere I go, I still have time to meditate.
