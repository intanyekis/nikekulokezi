Connor, a financier, was the former couple’s neighbor before their split last year.</p><p>Baumgartner was spotted with Connor last summer before she finalized her divorce from Costner, but the insider tells Us that Baumgartner insists the pair’s relationship only turned romantic “relatively recently.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kevin-Costner-Had-Strong-Suspicions-About-Ex-Wife-Christine-Baumgartner-and-Neighbor-Josh-Connor-097.jpg><p>Costner, meanwhile, has been <a href=#>linked to <strong>Jewel</strong></a> since last month, so “Christine doesn’t think Kevin has anything to complain about,” the source tells Us. “Josh has been Christine’s rock throughout the divorce ordeal. If Kevin has a problem with that, that’s on him.”</p><p>Baumgartner <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> from Costner in May 2023 after nearly 19 years of marriage, citing irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split. Court documents obtained by Us at the time listed the couple’s date of separation as one month prior.</p><p>As the duo battled in court over assets and child support, Costner questioned whether <a href=#>Baumgartner was faithful</a> after she requested documents relating to his finances.</p><p>“Respondent has no responsive documents for ‘extramarital romantic relationships’ in which he engaged because he engaged in none,” read court documents obtained by Us in August 2023. Costner’s attorneys also noted that the actor “does not know for a fact if [Christine] engaged in any ‘extramarital romantic relationships’ before separation and, if so, whether she spent any of his money or charged any expenses in furtherance of her affair(s) on credit cards he paid.”</p><p>That same month, Baumgartner testified in court that she and Connor <a href=#>were just friends</a> after they were photographed on a trip in Hawaii. She confirmed in the same testimony that Connor had loaned her $20,000, half of which she gave to her mother, per TMZ. She noted at the time that she returned the other $10,000 to Connor.</p><p>Costner and Baumgartner <a href=#>finalized their split</a> in September 2023. An insider told Us at the time that things between the pair had cooled off following their messy legal battle.</p><p>“They are now <a href=#>on speaking terms</a>. Things are better,” the source explained, adding that the exes “didn’t want it to get ugly for the kids’ sake.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The former couple share sons Cayden, 16, and Hayes, 14, and daughter Grace, 13. Costner also shares Annie, 39, Lily, 37, and Joe, 35, with ex-wife <strong>Cindy Silva</strong> and son Liam, 28, with ex <strong>Bridget Rooney</strong>.</p><p>For more on where Costner and Baumgartner stand now, watch the video above and pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaknaaeu26vzqyrp52iYrWisIysq6unnpx6tMHSqaCcoZ%2BjwG6twaisrWWVrXq4tcWeqmamlax6s7vMmqWcnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-aj-dillon-jewish-the-nfl-players-religion-faith-and-family-background.html><span>←</span><span>Is Aj Dillon Jewish?
