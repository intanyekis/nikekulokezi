I’m very, very lucky. So yeah, it’s been so cool.&nbsp;First and foremost, I’ve gotten the chance to work with some of the most talented people in the world when it comes to making really cool entrance music. Like for example, [Mikey] Rukus has done such an awesome job with so many themes and me getting to be hands-on with him and kind of tell him my exact concept and my exact idea. Because I’m one of those people that I’ll have an idea in my brain, but I can’t really put pen to paper. Or in his sense, I can’t make the notes match up and make the song sound cool.&nbsp;But he would take an idea of mine, which was very vague by the way.</p><p>“I think all I had mentioned was I wanted it to have a strong Rage Against the Machine feel. And then also I had a song in Ring of Honor called ‘<a href=# rel=noopener>Something For You</a>’ that was pretty popular amongst some people. And I wanted like a taste of that as well. And he ended up kind of using very similar drums within that song into <a href=# rel=noopener>my current song</a>. But man, it’s been so cool. I don’t know how I got so lucky for like every single stage of my career having really, really cool songs. But I’m pumped about it.”</p><p>Adam Cole most recently took part in a multi-man tag-team match alongside the ‘SuperKliq’ against the Dark Order, where he and his ‘Elite’ tag partners defeated their opponents on the special <a href=#>Saturday, 10/16 edition of AEW Dynamite</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFvZ3BoYmKupa3MZpqopJViubavyrJkna2ToHqmutOrmKeblWK6tr%2FInA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tabby-ridiman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-657163-html.html><span>←</span><span>Tabby Ridiman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
