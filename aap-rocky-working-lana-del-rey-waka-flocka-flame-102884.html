You like it?</p><p><strong>I love it, yeah. I think you make a great JFK. How did it come about?</strong><br>Lana wrote the treatment with me in mind. She wanted me to be the lead guy. Shit is like, everybody knows we got a thing for each other and we wanted to show that on screen. She’s a genius like…. nigga look at this bitch, I wanna fuck the shit outta her. Look at her she’s gotta be in her late 30s and shit… Err, Hello?</p><p><strong>Haha. You’re not talking about Lana Del Rey there I take it…</strong><br>Hahahaha nah, nah, nah. Nah, I was caught in the moment man; you know me Andy, cut it out man.</p><p><strong>Yeah I was like, “Wow, this is very forward of him.”</strong><br>Nah she wanted me to be the main guy and she wrote the treatment herself and came up with all the ideas. She came you with all that shit herself. And this guy Andy, nah, Anthony, what’s this nigga’s name…. Anthony Mandler shot it with some old cameras and shit to get the 1960s look and they had a set of extras. They had so many extras there, Interscope paid so much fucking money for this video that it’s not even true.</p><p>I tell you man, on set, I never did any kind of shit like this before with this much people involved and nothing like that so when I came on set with everybody dressed like they in the 60s and shit I really thought I was in the 60s. I’m serious. All joking aside – it was so realistic, I’m like DAMN.</p><p><strong>Yeah.</strong><br>And so I got in character like, “Fuck that like, I’m gonna be the black, trill JFK.” But basically I was just me, I don’t really think I did JFK no justice, (laughs). I was just me and it was like, “what if JFK met A$AP Rocky?” And that’s what you got. She looked like Jackie O, and I was kissing the shit out of her all day and shit.</p><p><strong>Must have been a tough gig.</strong><br>Nah that was good. I was like squeezing on her buns and all that shit. Doing all that perverted shit. (laughs) That was the fun part.</p><p><strong>Has she got a boyfriend?</strong><br>Nah, she hasn’t got no boyfriend.</p><p><strong>So, like, what’s up with that?</strong><br>You tell me…..</p><p><strong>No, you tell me…</strong><br>Nah, we just cool. I don’t look at her like that no more. I used to wanna do her, I used to wanna bone her but after this video I don’t like her like that no more, I just think she’s cool, know what I’m sayin?</p><p><strong>So she’s gonna be on your album, correct?</strong><br>Yeah, she’s gonna be on the song “My Bitch.” It was gonna be called “Ridin’,” but it’s actually “My Bitch.”</p><p><strong>Waka is on the A$AP album right?</strong><br>Yeah, Flocka’s on there, Pharrell’s on there but that’s all I can really announce right now. I can tell you, but not here with this conversation being in the press right now.</p><p><strong>Ok cool. Oh, I heard the London shows were crazy.</strong><br>Yeah, somebody tried to take my watch and shit. And all London started fucking the dude up and I got my watch back. They beat his ass. That’s what trill motherfuckers do, you should know. You’re a trill motherfucker from London.</p><p><strong>Stop it. I’m blushing. However, you are correct.</strong><br>I wanna move to London, wanna buy a crib in London.</p><p><strong>I think Rihanna’s got a place in Shoreditch near the <a href=# id=auto-tag_vice_3 data-tag=vice>VICE</a> office there.</strong><br>She does? Ok, I’m a go and visit her the next time I’m in London. Then, try and knock some boots y’know (more laughs and giggles).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5ausXnRqJqksV2svLO3yKeeZqSRo65usMSlZKudqWLEorfAZp2lp5Ogrm6yy5qknmVhZX95hJNo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./el-del-zarco-leaked-mms-scandal-video.html><span>←</span><span>Watch: El Del Zarco Leaked MMS Scandal Video Goes Viral, Sparks Outrage Online</span></a>
