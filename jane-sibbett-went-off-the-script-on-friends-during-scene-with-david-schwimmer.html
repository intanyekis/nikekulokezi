It was an emotional scene and as Sibbett revealed, she got completely lost in the moment, resulting in genuine tears. We'll take a look back at her approach during the scene, while also taking a closer look at Sibbett's thoughts about working along David Schwimmer.</p><p>In addition, we're going to reveal David's top moments of going off-script.

When it came to her journey on the show, Sibbett had nothing but positives to detail, and that included her relationship with David Schwimmer. Watching the actor work, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sibbett was blown away by David's approach to comedy</a>.</p><p>"I saw David Schwimmer do the most incredible take,” she said. “I'd never seen anybody do comedy like that. He literally took the longest take with his comedy. I just thought, oh my goodness, I have to work with this man. He is brilliant.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The Producers On Friends Instantly Realized They Messed Up Bringing In Jean-Claude Van Damme Based On How He Was Memorizing His Lines</a></span></p><p>Sibbett added that all these years later, she isn't surprised that Friends remains very successful with the new generation. The show is like a second family, according to the actress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Essentially, we still crave family. And now we're in this distracted generation and this distracted world where everybody's on their phones and not communicating anymore. And this was all about the family we choose. And I think right now in our world, there's a lot goin' down and we all really are craving comedy. We're all craving family."</p><p>The actress was also particularly fond of a certain episode on the show, and it would cause a moment between herself and David Schwimmer that was not planned, but was kept in given the emotions involved.</p><h2 id=jane-sibbett-went-off-script-given-the-emotions-involved-during-her-scene-with-david-schwimmer>Jane Sibbett Went Off Script Given The Emotions Involved During Her Scene With David Schwimmer</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The episode aired way back in February of 1995 during season one, episode 14. Fans get to see Carol and Ross share their final kiss, as Ross and his ex end up at the same restaurant on their dates.</p><p>The episode takes an emotional twist with Ross pouring his heart out, while Carol reveals that it is time for the two to move on from each other. Sibbett admits the scene was extremely difficult and that she got completely lost in the moment. This resulted in genuine tears which were not part of the episode.</p><p>“It was the sweetest, sweetest scene and we had to kiss,” she said alongside Today.</p><p>“It was so emotional and he made me cry. My eyes welled with tears as we were doing the scene because he was so tender and so loving and just ‘Can we make this work again?’ You know, when you're in it, the acting kind of dissolves away. And he kissed me and the thought that went through my mind is ‘He's really sweaty right now,' 'cause he was so nervous.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Anna Faris Was Terrified During Her Guest-Starring Role On Friends</a></span></p><p>In truth, the writers and producers were open to changing scenes along the way, especially given the reactions from the audience. As it turns out, a certain iconic scene from David Schwimmer was also completely improvised and kept in.</p><h2 id=david-schwimmer-improvised-another-major-moment-in-friends-history>David Schwimmer Improvised Another Major Moment In Friends History</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/david-schwimmer.jpg><p>Friends fans can argue that the, <a href=#>"I take thee Rachel," line is the most iconic of the entire series</a>. Truth be told, it was an organic moment... The writers struggled to come up with an ending for Ross and Emily's wedding. Then, a certain flub from David Schwimmer resulted in motivation for a proper conclusion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“We never knew how it was going to end. We struggled with it, we couldn’t figure it out. And then there was one time, at a taping, where David Schwimmer walked in the room. What he was supposed to say was ‘I have the cab waiting downstairs Emily’. But he walked in and said ‘I have the cab waiting, Rachel."</p><p>Schwimmer was no stranger to improvising iconic lines throughout his time on the show. The hilarious, "it taste like feet" line after eating Rachel's cake was also improvised by the talented actor. Similar to what Jane Sibbett alluded to, the actor had great delivery and timing, which made his comedy that much better throughout the ten seasons of Friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihmqaVYsCqrsGeq61lp5q7tXnOn51mrJiaerSv0aKnrWWfo3qnvsiepZ2rXZnCs7XNoGSsm5Wjsm7DyK2fZpyRq7aledKcn7ChnaKys3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./inside-the-challenges-ct-tamburello-ex-lilianet-solares-divorce.html><span>←</span><span>Inside The Challenges CT Tamburello, Ex Lilianet Solares Divorce</span></a>
