(Weinstein also shares daughters Lily, 28, Emma, 25, and Ruth, 21, with ex-wife <strong>Eve Chilton</strong>, whom he divorced in 2004.)</p><p>Chapman announced her split from Weinstein in 2017 after he was accused of sexual assault by multiple women. The former couple tied the knot in 2007 after three years of dating.</p><p>“My heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions. I have chosen to leave my husband,” Chapman said in a statement after the numerous allegations against Weinstein made headlines. “Caring for my young children is my first priority and I ask the media for privacy at this time.”</p><p>While the duo reached a <a href=#>confidential divorce settlement</a> in 2018, they didn’t finalize their split until July 2021.</p><p>“Harvey’s only thoughts are happiness for his family and the hope that his children are always cared for and happy,” Weinstein’s publicist told Us in a statement at the time. “He loves them and hopes that they know it and that one day soon, he can be closer to them.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Inside-Adrien-Brodys-Relationship-With-Harvey-Weinsteins-Ex-Wife-Georgina-Chapman-3.jpg><p>Weinstein was <a href=#>sentenced to 23 years</a> in prison in 2020 after he was convicted in New York on one count of rape and one count of criminal sexual assault. He was <a href=#>convicted on three counts</a> of rape and sexual assault in December 2022 in a separate case in California. Those charges were based on the account of a woman identified as Jane Doe #1, who claimed that the former movie mogul raped her after a 2013 film festival.</p><p>In February, Weinstein was sentenced to <a href=#>an additional 16 years</a> in prison for the California conviction. He had asked the court not to sentence him to life in prison, but the additional sentence means that he will likely spend the rest of his years behind bars.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Prior to his romance with Chapman, Brody was previously linked to <strong>Elsa Pataky</strong> and<strong> Lara Lieto</strong>.</p><p>For more on Brody and Chapman’s romance, watch the video above and pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaipqOesaZ5wJ2pop2eYq%2Bzu8OyZJqmlGK0prvRoKCnmV2YtaK8zJqlrGWjqr2xu9GtoK%2BdXae8rq3NnJxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gillian-turner.html><span>←</span><span>Gillian Turner</span></a>
