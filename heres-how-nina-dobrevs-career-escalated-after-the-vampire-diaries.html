Her big break occurred with the drama series Degrassi: The Next Generation when the actress joined the cast in Season 6 as Mia Jones. She portrayed the character of a high school student who later moved to Paris to pursue the dream of becoming a model. Dobrev left the show in Season 9 when a bigger opportunity was on the horizon in 2009. She bagged the role of Elena Gilbert in the CW drama <a href=#>The Vampire Diaries</a> that changed the trajectory of her career, and made her popular around the world.</p><p>Working alongside Paul Wesley and Ian Somerhalder, the trio received international recognition and took their career to new heights. Nina Dobrev has amassed an $11 million fortune through acting roles, brand endorsements, and business ventures.
