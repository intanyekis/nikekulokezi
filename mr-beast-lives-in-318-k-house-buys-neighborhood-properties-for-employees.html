When the YouTuber's first home was put up for sale in 2018, The Post was able to ascertain that he spent about $320,000 on it.</p><h2 class=split>The two-story home</h2><p>There are four bedrooms and four bathrooms in that 3,000-square-foot, two-story house. The kitchen came equipped with new granite countertops, a breakfast bar, a breakfast area, and a pantry. In the family area, there is an electric fireplace with gas logs. The ensuite bathroom, which features a double vanity, a jacuzzi tub, and a shower, is adjacent to the master bedroom and situated on the same floor. On the second story, there are three more bedrooms, a bonus room, and the laundry room. Among the features are a patio, a basketball court, a screened-in rear porch, and a separate storage building.</p><p>Later, MrBeast steadily started to purchase the remainder of the nearby homes for his family and staff, spending more than typical for each one. (The exception being the second home he paid $263,000 for there in 2020.) The remaining houses were bought off-market since they weren't on the market for sale. He paid a total of $1.45 million for those three houses the next year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRopaJir6at0q1kpaGmmsButc1mampwXaB6qbvUrJxmmqWuwG66xKKeoZqfp7Wwu8Nmp6unoJq%2FtbXErGSfp6Jisq68y6iwnp2j</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michelle-borth-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-607681-html.html><span>←</span><span>Michelle Borth Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
