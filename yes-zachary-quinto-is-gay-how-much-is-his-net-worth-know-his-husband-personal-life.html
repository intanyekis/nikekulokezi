Who Is Quinto's Husband? Know about his personal life from this article.</i></p><p>The wonderful actor who played the villain Sylar in the NBC drama <i>Heroes</i> is the one and only <strong>Zachary Quinto</strong>. He is well deserved in his praise as he has played characters such as the famous Spock<strong> </strong>in <i>Star Trek </i>to Tom Wingfield in the broadway performance of <i>The Glass Menagerie</i>.</p><p>With his striking looks and magnetic on-screen presence, Zachary has been a beloved fan favorite for ages. Beyond his acting abilities, Quinto is also a talented producer and director.</p><p>As an artist, Zachary&nbsp;has a keen eye for projects that challenge and inspire people and make great stories. He brings them to life on screen in a way that is both engaging and thought-provoking.</p><p>In this blog post, take a look at his personal life. Also, know more about the top searched topics about him such as: Is Zachary Quinto Gay?, What is Zachary's net worth? And many other things. So read the article till the end.&nbsp;</p><h2>Yes, Zachary Quinto Is Gay & Is Not Married To Anyone</h2><p>The <i>Aardvark </i>star Zachary Quinto has been very open about his sexuality ever since he came out in <strong>2011</strong>. He knew ever since he was young that he was attracted to men, something he talked about in a 2014 interview with Advocate magazine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/2/15/Zachary%20Quinto1-1676454507478.jpg><p>As of now, Zachary is not married to anyone but has dated a few in the past.&nbsp;</p><h3>How Did Zachary's Family React About His Sexuality?</h3><p>Years earlier, in <strong>2012</strong>, Zachary <a href=# rel=nofollow>talked about his sexuality</a> with his family members. He told <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>, that he came out to his mother and his older brother several years prior, and they were supportive and accepting of him.&nbsp;</p><p>Sadly, Zachary's father passed away much earlier and he regrets not having the chance to share that part of himself with his dad.&nbsp;</p><h3>Why Did Zachary Come Out To The Public?</h3><p>Zachary Quinto came out to the public mostly due to the sad death of <strong>Jamey Rodemeyer</strong>. At that time, Jamey was a 14-year-old gay teenager who used his platform to educate against homophobia.&nbsp;</p><figure class=media></figure><p>Jamey died due to <strong>suicide </strong>in 2011 after facing months of constant bullying and harassment, both in school and online. For the same reason, <a href=#><strong>Kim Gunn Gundy</strong></a>'s brother and Project Runway star<strong> Tim Gunn </strong>attempted<strong> </strong>suicide in 1968 at the same age. But luckily, Tim survived after being taken to the hospital.</p><p>In Zachary's personal blog, he came out as a gay man and said:</p><p>In light of Jamey's death -- it became clear to me in an instant that living a gay life without publicly acknowledging it -- is simply not enough to make any significant contribution to the immense work that lies ahead on the road to complete equality. Our society needs to recognize the unstoppable momentum toward unequivocal civil equality for every gay lesbian bisexual and transgendered citizen of this country.</p><p>The coming out did affect some of Zachary's professional projects but he has not regretted the loss. He stated that the reason he was silent for so long was because of how many gay people were treated in such a public career as acting. &nbsp;</p><h2>Zachary Quinto Gay: Was He Dating Miles McMillan?</h2><p>Zachary Quinto has never been married to date, just like <a href=#><strong>Randy Harrison</strong></a>. However, there were false rumors in <strong>2017 </strong>that he has secretly wed his then-hotshot boyfriend, model, and musician <strong>Miles McMillan</strong>. It all started when he was seen wearing a ring.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/2/15/31888456_2034049603515914_5851241012009107456_n%20(1)-1676454671799.jpg><p>Zachary has since then kept his love life a secret after amicably breaking up with Miles in 2019. Now, the public is not aware of his current partner.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, ex-boyfriend Miles has moved on and is dating interior designer <strong>Trace Lehnhoff</strong>. He has renovated <a href=#>Neil Patrick Harris</a>'s lavish Harlem townhouse in Manhattan.</p><h2>Zachary Is An LGBTQ Advocate</h2><p>Beyond Quinto's impressive acting abilities, his dedication to promoting equality and acceptance for the <strong>LGBTQ </strong>community has made him a true role model and inspiration to many.</p><p>As an openly gay man himself, Zachary has spoken openly about his own experiences and struggles. He has used his voice to support organizations and causes that work to promote equality and inclusion for LGBTQ+ individuals.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/2/15/60643864_134104664352875_637116785451610144_n%20(1)-1676454919118.jpg><p>The 6 ft 2 inches tall Zachary&nbsp;has been a vocal supporter of marriage equality and other legal protections for the LGBTQ+ community. He is also promoting greater visibility for &nbsp;LGBTQ+ characters in film and television.&nbsp;</p><h2>What Is The Net Worth Of Zachary Quinto?&nbsp;</h2><p><i>Star Trek Beyond</i> actor Zachary Quinto has an estimated net worth of about <strong>$20 million</strong>. He earned that money from his active acting career, his movie production, and his endorsements.&nbsp;</p><figure class=media></figure><p>In <strong>2018</strong>, it was made public that Zachary had a <strong>$3.2 million</strong> apartment loft in New York with his then-boyfriend Miles.
