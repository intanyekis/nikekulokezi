The actor went on to thank Cora, who died in 2017 at the age of 17, at the Emmy’s that year when he won Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for his work on Mad Men.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hamm had originally planned to foster Cora, but after meeting her, he discovered he couldn’t give her up. "Cora provides me with pure joy and love – and those are two pretty nice things to have in your life," he said.</p><p>"Cora was the best," Hamm told The New York Times in 2017, adding that he hadn’t been able to be <a href=#>by her side when she died</a>. "I was scheduled to fly in at 8 o’clock in the morning, and she passed away right before I got there. It’s been a real hard 24 hours," he said. "She brought a lot of love and a lot of good times to me. She'll always have a real sweet place in my heart."</p><p>According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), roughly 6.5 million pets enter US animal shelters each year. 1.5 million shelter animals are eventually euthanized. Meanwhile, approximately 3.2 million shelter animals, which includes 1.6 million dogs and 1.6 million cats, are adopted each year. Twenty-three percent of Americans with a dog found them through a shelter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Source: <a href=#>PEOPLE</a></p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Psychologist Claims Dogs Probably Dream About The Humans They Love</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmiin6N6qa3MpmSgoaaawG6%2BxKyarp1dmbyoecBmqp6bn6Oxbq%2FHmqWcnV2WwW64yJ%2BcaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-does-a-pontoon-boat-weigh-answers-with-examples.html><span>←</span><span>How much does a Pontoon Boat weigh?
